This is a two-track program with a GPR track with four 4 residents and an AEGD track with 2 residents. Both programs share clinical facilities, have the same auxiliary staff, utilize the same attending faculty and share didactic lectures. All 6 GDR residents rotate in OMFS for 6 weeks divided into two three-week rotations; Emergency Medicine for 2 weeks; 2 weeks in Otolaryngology; 1 week in Radiation/Oncology and have a 1 week elective rotation in a medical or dental specialty. The 4 GPR track residents rotate in Anesthesia for 2 weeks and the AEGD track residents rotate in Pediatric Dentistry for 2 weeks. We believe this merger emphasizes the strengths of both programs \u2013 comprehensive general dentistry on patients with complex medical histories. A second year in either program is offered each year for one resident. At the successful completion of the GDR program each resident will receive either a GPR certificate or an AEGD certificate depending upon the track selected.\n\n\n    The General Dental Residency (GDR) Program is a postdoctoral educational program designed to provide essential skills, attitudes, and abilities related to the contemporary practice of advanced general dentistry, with emphasis on total patient care. The program provides the recent graduate the opportunity to augment his/her knowledge of oral disease and his/her diagnostic and therapeutic skills in dentistry. Treatment of oral disease in the medically complex patient and/or hospitalized patient is emphasized. A private practice environment is maintained throughout the program to assist the recent dental school graduate in the transition from academics to \u201creal world dentistry\u201d.\n\n\n    The formal goals and objectives are:\n\n\n    The GDR Program co-sponsored by the University of Alabama-Birmingham School of Dentistry and the UAB Hospital consists of 12 months of advanced dental education in clinical dentistry and is conducted primarily within a hospital environment.  An optional second GPR or AEGD year is available on a competitive basis. This latter position is generally limited to one position per year and is dependent upon qualifications.\n\n\n    Goal 1: Act as a Primary Health Care Provider at a level more advanced than a GPR/AEGD Level 1 resident.\n\n\n    Provide multidisciplinary comprehensive dental care to a wide variety of patients by pursuing training in advanced dental clinical fields of interest including but not limited to:\n\n\n    Goal 2: Obtain more advanced didactic training in both medicine and dentistry. \n\n\n    They will be offered graduate level courses in the following areas:\n\n\n    Goal 3: Complete medical/dental rotations not offered to Level 1 residents. \n\n\n    These may include:\n\n\n    Goal 4: The Level 2 resident will assume more administrative responsibility in the administration of a GPR/AEGD residency.\n\n\n    Goal 5: The Level 2 resident will gain experience in the academics of dentistry. \n\n\n    These experiences will include:\n\n\n    Note: In pursuing these objectives the Level 2 (PG2) resident will not repeat Level 1 (PG1) rotations and academic courses. It is anticipated the Level 2 resident will spend 15% more time delivering clinical dental care. Each Level 2 resident in conjunction with the program director will tailor this Level 2 year to his/her interests.\n\n\n    The program begins July 1st and concludes June 30th. In general, entering residents are required to report approximately the 20th of June for UAB Hospital orientation and help in patient transition (date to be provided after acceptance to the program).\n\n\n    Formal postgraduate courses taken with other post-graduate dental students include Physical Diagnosis, Conscious Sedation, and Dental Management of the Medically Complex Patient.  A portion of most Thursday mornings is set aside for resident seminars that range from formal lectures to treatment planning sessions. At these sessions other issues are discussed relating to the clinic practice (scheduling, emergencies, etc.). All GDR residents, including those on rotation, are required to attend these sessions. Space permitting, continuing education courses offered by the School of Dentistry are available for a minimal fee to postgraduate students.  Approximately 30 courses are offered each year at UAB.\n\n\n    Although not required, opportunities for research are available for the interested resident. Time is limited, but several motivated residents have successfully participated in a variety of research endeavors. The program director can provide additional information.\n\n\n    Goal 1: To prepare residents to provide comprehensive general dentistry services at a level beyond that achieved as a Level 1 GPR/AEGD resident.\n\n\n   Goal 2: To improve the resident\u2019s ability to treat a wide variety of patients with complex medical histories and special needs.\n\n\n    Goal 3: To apply scientific principles to learning and oral health care.\nTo use the principles of critical thinking, evidence of outcomes-based clinical decision making and evidence-based decision information retrieval systems.\n\n\n\n    Goal 4: To utilize the values of professional ethics, lifelong learning, patient centered care, adaptability, and acceptance of cultural diversity in professional practice by acting as mentor for Level 1 residents.\n\n\n    Goal 5: To understand and participate in the oral health needs of communities and engage in community service.\n\n\n    Goal 6: To provide more advance clinical care than Level 1 residents in the following areas:\n\n\n    University Hospital Dental ClinicThe University Hospital Dental Clinic is a 13-chair dental facility located in the UAB Hospital. Each operatory is appropriately equipped. Digital radiography is available throughout the clinic.

It also strives to serve as an educational model in clinical diagnosis, treatment, research and resources in caring for these populations.\nThe division developed a one-year postdoctoral Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency in July 2004. The program graduated its first residents in June 2005.\nThe residency program has many unique features. Most patient care takes place away from the medical center, at the Camino De Salud Residency Clinic, which has the look and feel of a private dental practice. The residency clinic also houses the Dental Ambulatory Surgery Center, where sedation dentistry is practiced. Residents experience aspects of hospital dentistry through inpatient hospital consultations, coverage of the emergency room and treating dental patients in the operating room.\nThe AEGD Program provides the best possible environment for dental graduates to further their education through providing advanced comprehensive oral health care to medically compromised and special needs populations. And, they gain this experience while living in a beautiful Southwestern setting.\nThe deadline to apply to the new Postgraduate Year 2 Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency is\u00a0December 30. 2020. The program, which has two open spots, is designed to refine and enhance residents\u2019 clinical skills to improve general dentistry.\nBoth our Postgraduate Year 1 and Year 2 residencies begin\u00a0July 1, 2021. Students who have completed their first year of postgraduate General Practice Residency or the AEGD program are eligible to\u00a0apply [PDF].\nThe Advanced Education in General Dentistry Residency Program at The University of New Mexico in Albuquerque is looking for applicants who have integrity and good interpersonal skills \u2013 someone who is a team player, assumes responsibility and is reliable.\nWe evaluate applicant essays, externships or extracurricular experiences in general (or specialty) dentistry, letters of evaluation, general extracurricular experiences, public health experience or other work experience, GPR/AEGD/other specialty advanced program completions, publications, presentations and research.\nAll applicants must hold a DDS, DMD or equivalent degree from an accredited U.S. or Canadian dental school prior to admission to the program.\nProspective candidates may download an application from the ADEA PASS Application and Match Registration site. PASS provides a standardized format, relieving applicants of the need to complete multiple applications.\nMaterial must be submitted by January 5, 2021. Late applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nThe AEGD program is open to graduates of American Dental Association accredited DDS or DMD programs in the U.S. or equivalent programs in Canada. Applicants must have passed Part I of the National Dental Board Examination and must pass Part II of the National Dental Board Examination prior to beginning the AEGD residency.\nFor the 2021-2022 application cycle, the UNM School of Medicine AEGD residency program participates in PASS and the Match. The program also does not require applicants to take the Advanced Dental Admission Test (ADAT).\nThe Professional Evaluation Form (PEF) is available in the ADEA PASS application.\nThe Professional Evaluation Form (PEF) is the mandatory letter of recommendation. It does not limit evaluators to a specific topic as special or unique applicant experiences can be highlighted. The AEGD program at UNM requires three (3) letters of professional evaluation. ADEA PASS will process the PEFs per designation.\nThe Institution Evaluation Form (IEF, also called the dean\u2019s letter) is an evaluation of the applicant completed by the dean of the dental school attended. The completed IEF is then sent to every program a candidate applies to. Included in the IEF are NBDE scores or results, a narrative statement and GPA and class rank (if applicable). This evaluation is required for every applicant.\nThe Admissions Committee reviews applications and conducts interviews. We do not mandate a specific minimum grade point average or board score. However, a personal interview at UNM is required prior to admission.\nUNM policies are followed with regard to resident selection. The Division of Dental Services considers all applicants for admission to its AEGD program without regard for ethnicity, creed, religion, handicap, national origin, gender or age.\nResidency training rests on specific objectives and competencies at the Department of Dental Medicine at The University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. These objectives are used to meet the program\u2019s goals. Proficiencies and competencies are tools that measure the resident\u2019s success in meeting the objectives. Proficiency is a higher level of achievement than competency. Consequently, a resident can move from competency to proficiency in the course of the year.\nThese goals are assessed quarterly through multiple evaluations (both of and by the residents) and through an end-of-the-year questionnaire administered to the residents. Periodic surveys of recent graduates will also be used to supplement the data collected. These data are reviewed by the program director and faculty and if needed, appropriate action is taken to improve the resident experience.\nThis program intends for each individual to become competent or even proficient in each of the goals. It's expected that your clinical and didactic experiences will enable you to attain a level of skill and complexity far beyond that achieved in dental school.\nUNM\u2019s Advanced Education In General Dentistry residency program provides a one-year experience in general dentistry in outpatient clinics, the operating room and a hospital setting.\nThe program provides an opportunity and the structure to achieve these competencies, but it's the resident's responsibility to gather the documentation that these skills have been attained. Full- or part-time faculty members will complete most of this documentation on standard forms.\nAt the conclusion of the one-year program, each resident should have fulfilled a set of expected competencies [PDF].\nThe curriculum at the Department of Dental Medicine at The University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque includes required didactic and clinical core elements as well as elective assignments. Residents attend seminars as well as local continuing education programs offered by organized dentistry throughout the academic year.\nWe have created a 10-week Special Care Dentistry curriculum, which covers developmental disabilities, geriatrics, sedation and anesthesia, as well as hospital-based dentistry. Lectures, seminars, presentations, hands-on activities and other didactic coursework are part of this curriculum.\nResidents will learn to treat patients with developmental disabilities and qualify to use the New Mexico Department of Health \"Special Needs Code\" for higher reimbursement through clinic rotations, sedation clinic, operating room rotations, seminars and self-study modules. The seminar will cover specific developmental disabilities, management of maladaptive behaviors, use of restraints and positioning devices, use of sedation, treatment planning, prevention and legal issues.\nResidents will study the principles of geriatric dentistry and learn about the demographics and social trends of the aging population, clinical issues and treatment approaches for geriatric patients and pharmacological issues affecting dental therapy, while gaining an understanding of dementia in older people.\nWill review pediatric emergencies, management of oral infections, recognition of abuse, behavior management, pediatric restorative techniques, recognition of dental malocclusion and space maintenance.\nResidents will have clinical and didactic experience using nitrous oxide sedation, oral sedation and parenteral sedation techniques. The clinical experience will also involve treating patients under general anesthesia on an outpatient basis.\u00a0\nAs part of the sedation curriculum, residents will receive training and certification in both Basic Life support and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support during the residency year.\nIn addition to treating patients in an operating room setting, residents will learn formal operating room protocols, as well as the required gowning and gloving techniques.\nIdentify the critical steps for commonly used techniques in prosthodontics, understand procedures based on selected dental articles, share experiences and compare the clinical merits of various techniques.\nThe main goal is to allow residents to explore various topics in clinical dentistry in a problem-oriented manner, using Case Presentation, Journal Club, General Practice Presentation and Medical/Dental Interrelationships.\nCritically evaluate the dental and medical literature, perform literature searches, use the computer in literature search, word processing and data management and lead small groups. This is CERP-certified for continuing education credit. Community dentists are invited to attend.\nUse interdepartmental consultations to plan patient treatment, prepare well-organized case reports, speak before groups and understand the behavioral aspects of clinical dentistry.\nThe resident will learn to evaluate, diagnose and treat occlusal problems and how to evaluate the temporomandibular joint. This course combines seminars and clinical evaluation of patients.\nTo recognize and treat endodontic emergencies, diagnose endodontic problems and master filling techniques for single and multirooted teeth. To become familiar with rotary endodontic techniques.\nThe objectives are met through both clinical and didactic interaction. Seminars cover various issues in oral surgery, particularly the physical evaluation of a patient for surgery. This is followed by clinical patient treatment. Dental alveolar surgery skills will be taught, including surgical extractions, removal of impacted teeth and pre-prosthetic surgery. Additional seminars concerning surgical techniques are also provided.\nThis seminar will teach the resident to understand the differential diagnosis for orofacial pain. Neuropathic pain, headache disorders, muscle pain, disorders of the TMJ and oromotor disorders are examined. The pharmacology of pain management is discussed.\nTo teach residents about personal finances, types of insurance coverage a dentist should consider and dealing with debt. The series will also deal with the in and outs of practice acquisition, as well as types of practice arrangements.\nThe objectives are met through both clinical and didactic interaction.

Dental residents may be entitled to in-school deferments on existing student loans. If you are entitled to receive one, you should be proactive in ensuring that you receive your deferment.\nLenders must grant an in-school deferment based on enrollment and in-school status of a borrower as certified by an institution of higher education or an affiliated hospital. It is anticipated that lenders will be able to determine the borrower's eligibility for the deferment based on:\nAgain, dental residents must double-check to see if this has occurred. If the lender defers the loan based on a loan application or enrollment status information, the lender must notify the borrower that the deferment was granted and give the borrower the option of continuing to repay the loan.\nLoan consolidation can simplify repayment and may lower your monthly payment. You can combine your student loans even if you borrowed from more than one lender, have more than one type of loan or have different interest rates or repayment plans on the loans.\nYou must be in your grace period, deferment or in repayment to consolidate your loans. The following loans may be consolidated:\nYou can choose which loans to consolidate. Under certain circumstances, consolidation loans can be consolidated with other student loans. Check with the Direct Loan Program for details about loan consolidation.\nThe fixed interest rate is based on the weighted average interest rate of all the loans your consolidate, rounded up to the next highest 1/8%, with a maximum rate of 8.25%. Your student loan interest may be tax deductible if you meet certain conditions. Contact your tax advisor or the IRS for details.\nYou have a choice of a standard, graduated, income-sensitive or extended repayment plan, and you may change the repayment plan once a year. Depending on the total amount of your student loans, the repayment will take 10 to 30 years.\nContact the\u00a0Direct Loan Program\u00a0to apply for loan consolidation. If you are in repayment, the program can temporarily suspend your loan payments while your consolidation is being processed.\nThe following statements describe the graduates of Pacific's AEGD program. They are intended to communicate the expectations of the faculty to the resident and serve as the basis for evaluation of resident's satisfactory completion of the program.\nIn order to facilitate reading this list of statements,\u00a0certain terms have been predefined\u00a0to avoid repetitive definition.\u00a0In general, the definitions proposed by Chambers and Gerrow have been followed, albeit with some additions and modifications.\nIn situations where it is expected that the program graduate will be able to, and likely to, actually perform the necessary procedures, the terms \"perform\", \"provide\", \"restore\", or \"treat\" have been used.\nIn circumstances where the graduate may perform some treatment but is more likely to oversee treatment or refer, the term \"manage\" is used.\nTo avoid repetition, the term \"appropriate\" is not used in these statements. It is assumed that all knowledge, skills, and procedures described will be performed for appropriate reasons, in appropriate circumstances, and in an appropriate manner.\nEach statement is designated as an area of competency\u00a0(C)\u00a0in which graduates are expected to have little experience at the beginning of their programs, but\u00a0competent at a student level. \u00a0At the end of the program, the resident will gain further experience, skill, and judgment as the program progresses at a resident competency level.\nThe following are competency statements that describe the additional areas, beyond those of the first year program, that apply to residents completing the second year program. 1. Integrate all aspects of dentistry in the treatment of patients with complex dental, medical and social situations.\u00a0(C)\nAdapted from Chambers and Gerrow1\u00a0\nAssess.\u00a0Evaluation of physical, written, and psychological data in a systematic and comprehensive fashion to detect entities or patterns that would initiate or modify treatment, referral, or additional assessment. Assessment entails understanding of relevant theory, and may also entail skill in using specialized equipment or techniques. But assessment is always controlled by an understanding of the purpose for which it is made and its appropriateness under the present circumstances. Recognition is a more limited term that does not subsume the notion of evaluating findings. Diagnosis is a more inclusive term which relates evaluated findings to treatment alternatives.\nCompetency.\u00a0Behavior expected of the beginning practitioner. This behavior incorporates understanding, skill, and values in an integrated response to the full range of requirements presenting in practice. The level of performance requires some degree of speed and accuracy consistent with patient well-being but not performance at the highest level possible. It also requires an awareness of what constitutes acceptable performance under the circumstances and desire for self improvement.\nDiagnose.\u00a0Diagnosing means systematically comparing a comprehensive database on the patient with an understanding of dental and related medical theory to identify recognized disease entities or treatable conditions. The concept of diagnosis subsumes an understanding of disease etiology and natural history.\nDiscuss\u00a0(communicate, consult, explain, present).\u00a0 A two-way exchange that serves both the practitioner's needs and those of patients, staff, colleagues, and others with whom the practitioner communicates. The conversation, writing, or other means of exchange must be free of emotional or other distorting factors and the practitioner must be capable of expressing and listening in terms the other party understands. [Caution should be exercised with using these verbs to ensure that the communication is between the practitioner and the patient. Communication between the student and faculty is language reminiscent of the old instructional objectives and is not evidence of competency.]\nDocument.\u00a0Making, organizing, and preserving information in standardized, usable, and legally required format.\nManage.\u00a0Management refers to the selection of treatment-including: no intervention; choice of specific care providers-including hygienists, and medical and dental specialists; timing and evaluation of treatment success; proper handling of sequela; and insurance of patient comprehension of and appropriate participation in the process. In circumstances where the graduate may perform some treatment but is more likely to oversee treatment or refer, the term \"manage\" is used. In situations where it is expected that practitioners will be capable of and likely to provide treatment as well as oversee it, the terms \"treat\", \"provide\", or \"perform\", will be used.\nMonitor.\u00a0Systematic vigilance to potentially important conditions with an intention to intervene should critical changes occur. Normally monitoring is part of the process of management.\nObtain\u00a0(collect, acquire). Making data available through inspection, questioning (patients, physicians, relatives), review of records etc., or capturing data by using diagnostic procedures. Health histories, radiographs, casts, and consults are obtained. It is always assumed that the procedures for obtaining data are performed accurately so that no bias is introduced, are appropriate to the circumstances, and no more invasive than necessary, and are legal.\nPatients With Special Needs.\u00a0Those patients whose medical, physical, psychological, or social situations make it necessary to modify normal dental routines in order to provide dental treatment for that individual. These individuals include, but are not limited to, people with developmental disabilities, complex medical problems, and significant physical limitations.\nPerform (conduct, restore, treat).\u00a0When a procedure is performed, it is assumed that it will be done with reasonable speed and without negative unforeseen consequences. Quality will be such that the function for which the procedure was undertaken is satisfied consistent with the prevailing standard of care and that the practitioner accurately evaluates the results and takes needed corrective action. All preparatory and collateral procedures are assumed to be a part of the performance.\nPractice.\u00a0Used to describe a general habit of practice, such as \"practice consistent with applicable laws and regulations.\"\nPrepare\u00a0(see perform).\nPresent\u00a0(see discuss).\nPrevent\u00a0[the effects of]. The negative effects of known or anticipated risks can be prevented through reasonable precautions. This includes understanding and being able to discuss the risk and necessary precautions and skill in carrying out the precaution. Because preventing future damage is of necessity a response to an internalized stimulus rather than a present one, additional emphasis is placed on supportive values.\nProvide care\u00a0(see perform).\nRecognize\u00a0(differentiate, identify). Identify the presence of an entity or pattern that appears to have significance for patient management. Recognition is not as broad as assessment -- assessment requires systematic collection and evaluation of data. Recognition does not involve the degree of judgment entailed by diagnosis. [Caution is necessary with these terms. They are often use in the old instructional objectives literature to refer to behavior students perform for instructors. They can only be used for competencies when practitioners recognize, differentiate, or identify for patients or staff.]\nRefer.\u00a0A referral includes determination that assessment, diagnosis, or treatment is required which is beyond the practitioner's competency. It also includes discussion of the necessity for the referral and of alternatives with the patient, discussion and cooperation with the professionals to whom the patient is referred, and follow-up evaluation.\nRestore\u00a0(see perform).\nSkill.\u00a0The residual performance patterns of foundation skills that is incorporated into competency. The importance of the skill is more than speed and accuracy: it is the coordination of performance patterns into an organized competency whole.\nTreat\u00a0(see perform).\nUse.\u00a0This term refers to a collateral performance. In the course of providing care, precautions and specialized routines may be required. For example, infection control and rapport building communication are used. Understanding the collateral procedure and its relation to overall care is assumed. It is often the case that supporting values are especially important for procedures that are needed -- they are usually mentioned specifically because their value requires reinforcement. [\"Utilize\" is a stylistic affectation that should be avoided.]\nUnderstanding.\u00a0The residual cognitive foundation knowledge that is incorporated into competency. Understanding is more than broad knowledge of details: it is organized knowledge that is useful in performing the competency. [Caution should be used with this term. Understanding alone is not a competency; it must be blended with skill and values.] Values. Preferences for professional appropriate behavior in the absence of compelling or constraining forces. Values can only be inferred from practitioner's behavior when alternatives are available. \"Talking about\" values reflects a foundation knowledge; valuing can be inferred by observing the practitioner's attempts to persuade others. [Caution should be used with this term. Valuing alone is not a competency; it must be blended with skill and understanding.]\n155 Fifth Street\r\nSan Francisco, CA 94103", "Program Name": "University of the Pacific, Union City", "Program Type": "Advanced Education in General Dentistry (12 months)", "url": "https://dental.pacific.edu/dental/academic-programs/advanced-education-in-general-dentistry", "keywords": ["oral pathology", "facial pain", "satisfactory completion", "necessary precautions", "further experience", "psychological data", "collateral procedure", "pediatric dentistry", "most application", "advanced training"]},

Graduates of the program are proficient in the anesthetic management \u2013 in both hospital and non-hospital settings \u2013 of a wide range of dental patients including: children, special needs patients, phobic adults, the medically compromised, patients with extensive treatment plans and the trauma patient.\nTo see a list of locations where Dental Anesthesiology is offered, click here.\n$68,082\n$71,754\n\nThe program began in July 2008 and in 2010 was fully accredited without reporting requirements by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Located in the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn, NYU Langone Hospitals-Brooklyn is recognized as a Level 1 Trauma Center. In this environment residents gain experience providing anesthesia services to a diverse mix of patients often presenting with significant comorbidities. The clinical and didactic components of the program are interwoven so that knowledge and theory are absorbed and retained in the crucible of real time anesthesia practice in a busy OR suite.\nOur goal is to provide our residents with the most effective combination of clinical and didactic instruction in dental anesthesiology. Upon graduation we expect our residents to be fully proficient in the anesthetic management of children, adults and the mentally and developmentally disabled or special needs patient \u2013 whether in the dental office, ambulatory surgicenter or inpatient setting.\nResidents who have graduated from this program practice as dental anesthesiologists in a wide variety of professional environments. These include mobile office-based anesthesia practices across the country, ambulatory surgicenters and a full-time anesthesia staff position in a children\u2019s hospital. Office-based anesthesia is a rapidly growing field that will continue to provide excellent practice opportunities for appropriately trained dental professionals.\nDental Anesthesiology residents participate in regular journal club sessions to keep abreast of current research and learn to use an evidence-based approach to critical reviews of the anesthesiology literature. Additionally, residents participate in an intense orientation lecture series as PGY-1 residents, in weekly grand rounds, and frequent lectures by faculty.\u00a0\nResidents complete a research project\u00a0under the guidance of the Director of Dental Research and present their findings at NYU Langone, ASDA/ADSA Meetings or other educational forums approved by the Program Director. Research projects may be: hypothesis-driven clinical research, formal case reviews/case studies or systematic reviews.\nResidents integrate evidence based findings into daily practice and strive for continual improvements in efficacy and safety of anesthesia services for dental patients throughout their residency and career.\nThis 36-month hospital-based program offers hands-on training in the anesthetic management of patients in the operating room, outpatient clinic and dental office setting.\u00a0NYU DA\u00a0Residents are trained in the full spectrum of anesthesia skills from intubated general anesthesia to IV/IM/oral sedation. \u00a0Much of the training occurs in the main OR suite at NYU Langone where residents are directly involved in providing anesthesia for a wide variety of general surgical cases. On a regular basis, Dental Anesthesiology residents take overnight call where they participate in emergency cases as part of the anesthesia team. First-year residents spend significant time training in the OR as well as on off-service rotations in medicine and pediatrics.\nSecond- and third-year residents continue rotation in the OR suite but also attend more focused clinical rotations. \u00a0Second-year residents spend two months on rotation in mobile office-based anesthesia. \u00a0In this rotation, residents spend time embedded in each of the practices of the dentist anesthesiologists associated with the rotation. \u00a0Second-year residents also spend two months on rotation in a surgery center dedicated to the anesthetic management of patients with special needs.\u00a0 In conjunction with the addition of the third-year to the Dental Anesthesiology Program curriculum, each PGY-3 DA residents spend four additional months on rotation in mobile office-based anesthesia.\nThe overall goal of the Dental Anesthesiology Program is to produce graduates that from day 1 are competent\u00a0 anesthesia providers in the dental office, ambulatory surgery center and Main OR suite settings.\nThe Dental Anesthesiology Program offers its postgraduate residents\u00a0generous stipends and fringe benefits which are competitive with other hospitals in the New York metropolitan area.\nThe application deadline is October 1st.

This deposit will be applied to your postgraduate program fees when you matriculate. It will be forfeited if you fail to enroll in July.\nImmunizations: Each entering resident must verify at the time of matriculation that he or she has completed the accepted routine of vaccinations. An immunization record is required in order for the resident to be registered.\nNebraska Licensure: All postgraduate residents are required to get a Nebraska Dental License (temporary or regular) and federal and state DEA licenses before September 1 of the year of their admission.\nFailure to obtain Nebraska Dental License and federal and state DEA licenses by September 1 will result in a reduction of duties, reduction or elimination of stipend, an extension of time necessary to complete program requirements, or dismissal from the program.\nIt is possible for a resident who has graduated from an A.D.A. accredited American or Canadian dental school to obtain a temporary Nebraska Dental License during the time he or she is enrolled as a full time postgraduate resident. The temporary license is only for practice related activities within the College of Dentistry.\nAfter acceptance into the postgraduate program licensure information may be obtained from the State of Nebraska Department of Health, Bureau of Examining Boards, P.0. Box 95007, Lincoln, NE 68509 5007.\nFor a regular license, the State Board accepts the results of the clinical examination given by the Central Regional Dental Testing Service. The State Board also has provisions for licensure by credentials and interview for individuals licensed in other states.\nEquipment Purchase: All residents accepted into the program are required to purchase an endodontic microscope.\nScholarly Activity: During their tenure at the University of Nebraska, each resident is required to engage in some type of scholarly activity presented or published outside of the College of Dentistry. Common examples would be submission of a paper to a refereed journal, or presentation of an abstract or poster at a regional or national meeting. The subject matter of this scholarly activity may be results of their research, a case report, or a literature review. This program requirement will be verified, prior to graduation, by the program director.\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): Each resident is required to be certified and maintain certification in basic CPR. A copy of the valid certification in basic CPR must be maintained at the College of Dentistry. Re-certification is available at the College of Dentistry.\nEmergencies and After-Hour Patient Care: The College of Dentistry has determined that a course in Emergencies and Pain Control and participation on the CODE BLUE team and the After Hours Emergency Care Program are part of the academic program for all residents located in programs housed in the College of Dentistry in Lincoln. The course will be scheduled during the first year as a required course for all new postgraduate residents.\nOrganizations: Each resident is strongly urged to participate in professional organizations, particularly the American Dental Association and the American Association of Endodontist (AAE). Attendance at the annual meeting of the AAE is encouraged as well as attendance at local dental and endodontic meetings.\nPatient Treatment: Each resident is required to adhere to departmental and college policies and procedures regarding patient care. These policies and procedures include those outlined in the Operations Manual and Clinical Policies Manual. In addition, each resident is required to review with the departmental faculty all cases assigned for patient care. This process will include a pretreatment evaluation (to establish a diagnosis and treatment plan), treatment procedures, postoperative results, and recall evaluations.\nDuring this process the resident will also be required to consult with faculty from other departments within the college to insure both quality and continuity in patient care. Following completion of each case, the resident will refer the patient for appropriate restorative therapy, and recall the patient at prescribed intervals to evaluate the patient's response to treatment. Upon completion of the program the resident will review and transfer each case he has treated and is currently treating to a first year postgraduate resident. As a minimum each resident will complete the number of cases required by the American Board of Endodontics.\nClinical treatment will be provided at the dental school in Lincoln for patients of record there. Additionally, residents may provide clinical treatment while on rotations at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Lincoln and the Munroe Meyer Institute in Omaha, GPR program in Omaha, and surgery rotation at Creighton University in Omaha.\n2020-21 Program Costs\nFor postgraduate students with a U.S. or Canadian dental degree, and Nebraska residents.\nClinical Fees $2,806 Fall Term (July 1-December 31) $2,806 Spring Term (January 1-June 30) $5,612 Per Year\nEquipment Assessment $2,050 Per Year\nTotal $7,662 Per Year\nOne time $30 fee for background check.\nCurrently, GME-eligible (U.S. or Canadian dental degree) Endodontics residents will be appointed as 1.0 FTE employees and will receive a salary. GME-eligible postgraduate residents are eligible for a flexible benefit package which includes choices among health, life, and disability insurance.

Violation of this clause may result in dismissal from the program.\nThe University of Nebraska has in force professional liability insurance covering all residents within the College of Dentistry.\nCurrent coverage is $1,000,000 per person per occurrence, with $100,000 deductible. The University provides self insurance for the $100,000 deductible through the University's general and professional liability insurance program.\nAs employees of the University, GME eligible postgraduate residents are considered to be residents of the State of Nebraska. Ordinarily residents who are not GME eligible are considered not to be residents of the State of Nebraska.\nIn conjunction with a resident\u2019s education leading to a Certificate of Specialization in Endodontics, a program is available to complete the requirements for a M.S/Ph.D degree.\nA program is available and awarded by the Graduate College through the College of Dentistry in the Medical Sciences Interdepartmental Area (MSIA).\nThe program consists of expanded course-work, the conduct of an approved research project, and the submission of a formal thesis. This program is administrated by the graduate college and is not related to the certificate program; there is no clinical component, and extra course work may be required depending on the resident\u2019s area of study. If interested in being admitted to the Graduate College, it is important to make a formal application as soon as possible after acceptance into the postgraduate program. Extra time will be needed to meet the requirements of the M.S./Ph.D. degree.\nIn accordance with University policy, UNMC prohibits the denial of admission or of Medical Center privileges to residents or applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability or religious or political beliefs. These privileges include but are not limited to admission, class assignments, scholarships, fellowships, assistantships, and financial aid, as well as housing and recreational facilities. Furthermore, resident organizations must base their selection of residents for membership on criteria which will not include race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.\nAdmittance to UNMC programs will not be denied to otherwise qualified disabled individuals solely by reason of their disability. Qualified disabled persons are those who meet the academic and technical standards for each program. These nonacademic skills are essential to successful program completion.\nIn summary, UNMC policies are in accord with:\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Sections 799A and 854 of the Public Health Services Act Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\nThe objective of the University of Nebraska Medical Center is to recruit and retain persons of high moral and ethical character.

This two-year program of rigorous didactic and intensive clinical training is designed to prepare a dentist for the independent practice of endodontics. Upon successful completion of the program, students will receive a Certificate in Endodontics from Columbia University.\nThe College of Dental Medicine's Endodontic Clinic serves the needs of a large and diverse population. As students progress through their two years of clinical training they have the opportunity to treat a large number of patients who present with a wide range of endodontic problems and require increasingly complex diagnoses, treatment plans, referral schedules, and medical consultations. The clinical faculty, most of whom are successful practitioners in New York City, have received their training from many different universities and bring vast clinical experience to share with their students.\nPostdoctoral students participate in predoctoral teaching both to share their knowledge, skills, and experience with less advanced students and to further their own training since teaching is an excellent way of learning. The Division of Endodontics is strongly research-oriented; research skills and an appreciation and understanding of endodontics research are integral to the curriculum. All students participate in at least one research project.\nThe didactic program includes core biomedical science courses and intermediate and advanced endodontics courses, providing the knowledge base and analytical skills needed by the future endodontist as well as the life-long learning abilities to continue professional growth throughout his/her career.\nStudent research is an integral part of the curriculum of the program. Students have the opportunity to work with faculty members on research projects that are relevant to many areas of Endodontics.

Root canal or endodontic treatment is a procedure performed to remove damaged tissue from inside the root canals of a tooth. As a specialist, endodontists limit their practice to endodontic procedures.\nThe Department of Endodontics supports the Dental School Mission toward the enhancement of oral health through acquisition, dissemination and use of endodontic evidence based\u00a0knowledge. This mission is addressed through four interrelated action components: education, patient care, research and community service.\nEducational Goal: Our education goal is to develop residents whom will\u00a0have the evidence based knowledge, clinical skill, attitude to provide patient centered\u00a0care and engage in lifelong learning.\nPatient Care Goal: Our patient care goal is to develop qualified, skillful clinicians who practice endodontics with state-of-the-art armamentaria and philosophies. New endodontists will treat and re-treat all types of teeth which need root canal therapy, perform vital pulp therapy,\u00a0revascularization procedures, perform routine and advanced endodontic surgical procedures, manage traumatic injuries and the emergency needs of their patients, and treat medically compromised patients.\nResearch Goal: Our research goal is to provide an environment in which research and the dissemination of scholarly activity are performed by its faculty and endodontic graduate students. All should have an appreciation for research design and critical review of the literature.\nCommunity Service Goal: Our community service goal is to develop endodontists who are trained to lecture and teach in a clinical setting in a dental school, who give presentations to dental societies and study clubs, and who are a part of organized dentistry.\nDepartment Chair &amp; Program CoordinatorEmail Dr. Pileggi\nClinical Assistant ProfessorEmail Dr. Bakiri\nAssociate Clinical ProfessorEmail Dr. Cerrud\nAssociate ProfessorEmail Dr. Haddix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Clinical ProfessorEmail Dr. Soares Leibovitch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Assistant ProfessorEmail Dr. Peinado\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Assistant ProfessorEmail Dr. Zongker\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Clinical ProfessorEmail Dr. Kanter\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjunct Clinical ProfessorEmail Dr. Manne", "Program Name": "University of Florida, Gainesville", "Program Type": "Endodontics", "url": "https://dental.ufl.edu/departments/endodontics/", "keywords": ["oral health", "scholarly activity", "endodontic procedures", "lifelong learning", "endodontic evidence", "new endodontists", "educational goal", "clinical skill", "clinical setting", "endodontic treatment"]},

Romano, DMD\nProgram Director, General Practice Residency, Department of Dentistry\nYale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) offers a one-year residency in all phases of dentistry, accredited by The Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. This certificate program is designed to develop essential clinical skills, attitudes, judgment and abilities related to the comprehensive practice of dentistry. The program is also structured to provide training in the management of medically, physically, and intellectually disabled patients in a hospital environment. In addition to comprehensive training in all disciplines of dentistry, the dental resident will participate in restorative dentistry and oral surgical procedures in the operating room. The resident will be on off-service rotations in YNHH's Department of Internal Medicine [2 weeks], Anesthesiology (2 weeks), Emergency Medicine (1 week), YNHH's Pediatric Dental Department (2 weeks in Pediatric Dental Clinic), and Oral Maxiollfacial Surgery (2 weeks).\nOur patient base provides ample opportunities for gaining or expanding the resident's experience in disciplines such as implant dentistry, fixed and removable prosthodontics, esthetic dentistry, pain management beyond the use of local anesthetics and more. In addition to the department's clinic setting, the resident will be able to provide comprehensive dental care in the operating room and work with physicians and other health care providers throughout the hospital. Clinical training is supplemented with an array of lectures, seminars and conferences throughout the year. The resident will have the privilege of working with a variety of dental and medical specialists in both clinical and classroom settings.\nThe GPR program is clinically oriented, with 80% of the resident's time devoted to providing dental care. The remaining time is devoted to lectures, medical rotation and various non-clinical didactic experiences.\nYNHH Dental Residency Program participates in the Postdoctoral Dental Matching Program (\u201cthe Match\u201d) for its four PGY 1 General Practice Residency positions. Interested applicants must submit an application and all supporting documents online through the Postdoctoral Application Support Service (PASS). American Dental Education Association (ADEA) PASS applicants who seek positions that use the Match program must register through both organizations, using the ADEA PASS portal. After applying, applicants may be invited to participate in the interview process. No offers are made during the interview period. Programs and applicants create an order of preference, resulting in a \u201cRank Order List.\u201d The ranking is then submitted through the Match and a comparison of the lists are used to place students into positions. For more information about the Postdoctoral Dental Matching process, please visit www.natmatch.com\nOur challenging didactic curriculum components include: physical diagnosis; weekly conferences and seminars; monthly grand rounds and case discussions; literature review and case-based learning.\nThis program exposes the general dentistry resident to periodontics from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective, instilling the need to integrate periodontics into generalized treatment planning. Residents treat all periodontal patients under the direct supervision of licensed and board-certified periodontists. Residents obtain full mouth radiographs, diagnostic casts, and create treatment plans with the attending Periodontist. Residents may carry out initial patient preparation in the absence of a periodontist, and patients requiring subsequent periodontal surgery will be treated by the resident and periodontist together. Additional material covered includes non-surgical periodontal therapy, antibiotic and chemotherapeutic agents. The introduction of surgical therapy will include apically repositioned flap, modified Widman flap, gingival grafts, osseous resection, gingivectomy, osseous grafting, and crown lengthening procedures.\nThe objectives of the Periodontal Program are to develop in-depth ability to diagnose and coordinate the treatment of periodontal diseases. The resident is expected to gain knowledge of currently available treatment modalities and to develop skills to execute periodontal procedures. The resident will gain additional knowledge in diagnosis and treatment planning, integrating periodontics, general dentistry, orthodontics, prosthodontics and implant dentistry.\nGeneral Dentistry residents are expected to learn how to diagnose pulpal disease and orofacial pain, including concise methods of testing for pulpal pathology and accurate interpretation of test results. The resident will become familiar with conditions that mimic endodontic disease and the appropriate treatment of endodontic disease.\nGeneral dentistry residents are expected to perform a variety of oral surgical procedures in the dental clinic and are encouraged to participate on oral and maxillofacial surgery operating room cases at Yale New Haven Hospital. The educational objectives include proficiency in exodontia, oro-facial wound repair; treatment of acute and chronic infections of dental origin, the initial and definitive management of dentofacial trauma; surgical management of the medically compromised patient; and diagnosis and treatment of pathologic lesions of the soft and hard tissues of the mouth.\nYale New Haven Hospital is dedicated to preventative and restorative dentistry for the physical and intellectually disabled patients. We are committed in particularly in the areas of caries restoration, infection control, oral surgery, dental prophylaxis and general anesthesia in the operating room. We perform general dentistry operating room procedures weekly.\nThe two-week oral and maxillofacial surgery rotation will provide the resident with direct insight and overview of new advances in the treatment of maxillofacial surgery. The resident will discuss treatment options for the pathologic conditions of the maxillofacial region, develop a comprehensive evaluation of a trauma patient, identify approaches for treatment and options of managing post-operative pain. The resident will learn to evaluate and assess dentoalveolar surgeries, different types of dental implants, and will learn to recognize the impact of systemic diseases on patient management.\nO.R.

Based in the UPMC Montefiore Dental Center on the UPMC Presbyterian/Shadyside Campus, the program enrolls a combined total of three (3) residents each year. Residents completing the GPR earn a Certificate of Training.\nGuided by the philosophy that oral health is an integral and interactive aspect of total health, residents engage in approximately nine months of comprehensive dental care.\u00a0 The remaining three months are spent on rotations in anesthesia, emergency medicine, internal medicine, and oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nIn addition to intensive exposure to hospital-based dentistry, the program provides clinical and didactic training across a range of dental specialties, including endodontics, periodontics, implant dentistry, prosthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral pathology/oral medicine, head and neck oncology patients, transplant and cardiothoracic surgery patients \u00a0and treating patients with complex medical histories. Instruction is also provided in ancillary topics pertinent to dental practice, such as patient evaluation and physical examination, emergency medical care, treatment of traumatic dental injuries, inpatient care and hospital organization, and a multitude of other medical and dental subjects.\nIn addition to the delivery of clinical care in the UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Dental Center and Hospital, the residents will rotate through the UPMC Mercy Hospital Emergency Department, Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh Free Care Dental Center and The University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine Interdisciplinary Implant Center.\nJournal Club, treatment planning conferences, resident portfolios and off-site local and national dental meetings are also part of the program content. \nResidents will be required to provide 24-hour, on-call emergency services as scheduled by the residency director. Short-range and long-range pagers will be provided to each resident. Residents are not often required to remain in-house, but usually take call from home. \nThe General Practice Dental Residency Program is designed to provide training beyond the level of pre-doctoral education in oral health care, using applied basic and behavioral sciences.\u00a0 Education in this program is based on the concept that oral health is an integral and interactive part of total health.\u00a0 The program is designed to expand the scope and depth of the residents\u2019 knowledge and skills to enable them to provide comprehensive oral health care to a wide range of population groups.\u00a0 The goals of this program are derived from the Commission on Dental Accreditation\u2019s (CODA) Standards for Advanced Education Programs in General Practice Residency.\nSpecific to the UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Dental Center General Practice Residency Program, the program will prepare each resident to:\nThe UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Dental Center is a resident-driven clinic. Residents must be supervised either directly or indirectly, with direct supervision immediately available (i.e. attending dentist is in the hospital or other site of care and is immediately available to provide direct supervision). Much of the learning process and the development of progressive responsibility is based on teaching by example under supervision. Supervision and close observation provide the ability of the program director to ascertain when a resident is ready and able to assume progressive autonomy and responsibility. Each resident must know the limits of their scope of authority and the circumstances under which they are permitted to act with conditional independence as well as their skill set and experience. Attending doctors always maintain professionalism within this relationship and will encourage residents to practice with increasing autonomy while freely seeking guidance from the attending at any time the resident believes it to be helpful to the care of the patient. This relationship is designed to be reciprocal and fundamental to the residents\u2019 successful progression. \nThose interested in making application to the program may do so through the\u00a0American Dental Education Association\u2019s Postdoctoral Application Support Service (PASS).\u00a0 This program participates in the National Dental Match. \nFor additional information about the application process, please contact \nAndrea Ford\nCoordinator, UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Hospital\nOMFS/GPR Dental Residency Programs\nfordam@upmc.edu\n412-648-6801\nOctober 15 of each year\nWhile in the program, residents receive UPMC Health System\u2019s postgraduate trainee stipend.\u00a0\nBenefits include 10 days (80 hours) paid time off, 3 days (24 hours) of paid time off for job-search-related activities, healthcare insurance for the trainee and dependents.

The GPR Program emphasizes the management and treatment of Special Needs and underserved patients including children and adults with developmental disabilities, Autism Spectrum Disorder, the medically challenged, pediatric, anxious and geriatric in the outpatient clinic, with conscious sedation and general anesthesia in the operating room, in the Emergency Department, on rotation in Oral Surgery at John H. Stroger Hospital, Chicago, IL, and on the mobile dental van.\nAdvocate Illinois Masonic, a member hospital of Advocate Aurora Health, the tenth largest health care system in the U.S., is one of the state\u2019s largest, most comprehensive medical centers, offering a wide range of medical specialties, and a commitment to clinical expertise and education. Advocate Illinois Masonic is a Level I trauma, 408 bed teaching hospital with over 900 active physicians and 225 residents. The Advocate Illinois Masonic Department of Dentistry is a full, free-standing clinical department, equal in parity with the other clinical departments of the hospital. The Department Chair, the Program Directors, Section Heads, and faculty members who represent all of the dental specialties are responsible for the teaching and clinical aspects of the program.\nDentistry and the GPR and Dental Anesthesiology Programs at Advocate Illinois Masonic are considered integral components of the institution. Program residents provide many services to the hospital including ED coverage and consults to cardiology, anesthesia and radiation oncology. Residents have access to many educational opportunities provided by many hospital departments including rotations in Internal Medicine with the Hospitalist service, in Anesthesia and in the Emergency Department. Residents also rotate through the outpatient Oral Surgery Clinic at John H. Stroger Hospital.\nThe Department of Dentistry also now sponsors a two resident per year, three year CODA accredited Dental Anesthesiology Residency Program. Residents in this program receive intensive, comprehensive training in providing the full range of anesthesia services for pain and anxiety control for a wide variety of patients including pediatric, special needs, anxious and geriatric patients. GPR residents work closely with Dental Anesthesiology residents to develop appropriate treatment plans and provide safe, effective anesthesia services for optimal delivery of dental treatment.\nThe mission of the Advocate Illinois Masonic Dental Residency Program is to prepare residents for the practice of general dentistry through education and exposure to the broadest range of clinical and didactic experiences. The program emphasizes the treatment of underserved populations with limited access to dental care in multiple clinical settings including the outpatient Dental Center, in the operating room as inpatients and on the mobile dental van.\nThe GPR program provides dental graduates with advanced training in the diagnosis and delivery of dental treatment to healthy as well as medically compromised and developmentally disabled individuals. Residents will also learn more complex treatment in all phases of general dentistry. The program also trains residents to function effectively in various hospital rotations such as emergency medicine, anesthesia, internal medicine hospitalist service and oral surgery and provide comprehensive dental treatment in the operating room. Residents will manage in-patient and same-day surgery cases from admission through discharge. What makes our GPR program unique is the clinical experience and the evidence-based approach to patient care.\nOur residents treat patients of all ages from very diverse backgrounds which provides a wide range of clinical experiences. Many of these patients are treated in the dental clinic under IV sedation, or general anesthesia, or in the operating room under general anesthesia. The 2 operatory, fully equipped dental van travels to sites in Chicago and the metro region to provide treatment to children, special needs adults, the indigent, and geriatric patients, so that residents are able to treat a largely underserved population.\nThe overall goals of the Advocate Illinois Masonic residency program are to prepare residents for the practice of general dentistry through education and exposure to the broadest range of clinical and didactic experiences. The program emphasizes an evidence-based approach to dental treatment through critical review of the dental literature, treatment of underserved populations with limited access to dental care, special patient dentistry, and providing oral health care in a hospital setting. This program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA), and all policies, procedures, and activities must be in compliance with CODA standards and Advocate Graduate Medical Education (GME policy).

The current program is fully accredited and provides training for four first-year  positions. There are provisions for an additional year of training to one or  two residents each year. Residents receive instruction and obtain experience in  all phases of inpatient and ambulatory dental care under the supervision of  attending dentists.\nThe volume of outpatients who desire care in this  facility is such that those residents have the opportunity to undertake a  variety of clinical experiences that will be of benefit to their overall  training. This population, along with patients seen from inpatient services,  provides broad training in the dental management of the medically compromised.\nThe overall objective of this hospital based program is  to produce general dentists who have developed a level of clinical competency  that will allow them to practice where there is an increased reliance on total  patient evaluation, and alongside their colleagues in the health care  community. These broad objectives have the following specific goals: \nAct as a primary care  provider for individuals and groups of patients.

The favorable faculty-resident ratio allows for an enhanced learning experience through personal guidance.\nThe department's longstanding academic associations with the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine and Temple University School of Dentistry broaden and enrich the residents' educational experiences. Dental students from the University of Pennsylvania complete rotations at Einstein Healthcare Network and the three institutions freely share information and resources.\nGraduates of our programs are rewarded with abundant career opportunities.\u00a0\nFrom one resident and a single operatory in 1926, the department has expanded to 20 residents and 21 operatories in a modern 8,000 square-foot facility in the medical center's outpatient area. Einstein Healthcare Network's emergency department has an ever growing populace of patients requiring our unique skills, offering dental residents the opportunity to care for dental emergencies in the emergency unit.\nIn addition, dental residents provide dental treatment for patients under general anesthesia in the Medical Center's major operating suite\nIn the clinical area, the department's Implantology Program, which employs several contemporary systems, reflects Einstein's Commitment to innovation in dental medicine. This was the first hospital-based outpatient program of its kind in Philadelphia.\nMost recently, major clinical renovations occurred including placement of new dental delivery systems in all 3 programs areas. Also, all dental imaging systems were converted to digital technology including the placement of a 3D Cone Beam unit utilized by the 3 residency programs. Residents present table clinics, poster displays and research papers at regional and national meetings.\nMajor endowments add to the level of academic and clinical excellence at Einstein Healthcare Network. The Maxwell S. Fogel Department of Dental Medicine, the I.B. Bender Division of Endodontics, the Phillip S. Kanev Division of Restorative Dentistry and the Jack Magill Orthodontic Clinical Facility have been named in recognition of these individuals.\nThe department also sponsors four endowed conferences: the Morris Kelner Memorial Conference on Pediatric Dentistry, the Steven P.

Specimens range from common cysts after root canal or from impacted wisdom teeth to complex tumors on the tongue or in the throat.\nA wide variety of benign and malignant pathologic lesions can occur in the oral cavity and jaw. These lesions can be present on - or within - the intraoral soft and hard tissues. Specifically, they may invade or occur in the following tissue areas:\nThe source of pathologic lesions is often unknown; however some can arise from infections, trauma, environmental insults, tobacco, alcohol, genetics, and congenital causes.\nMount Sinai is one of the few hospitals offering the specialized service of oral pathology. Patient benefits of this specialty are threefold:\n\u201cIf a patient has an oral lesion, he or she needs a pathologist with a thorough understanding of the teeth and jawbone to determine whether it is related to the teeth or not,\u201d says Dr. Ramer. \u201cOral pathology requires extensive training in blisters, a burning mouth, herpes, prescription drug reactions and oral manifestations of systemic diseases, such as Crohn\u2019s disease.\u201d Without this specialized skillset, a misdiagnosis is more likely to occur.\nOnce our oral pathologist determines the diagnosis, advanced imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI may be necessary.

The didactic curriculum is extensive because little of the required pain sciences are presented in pre-doctoral or post-doctoral training programs.\u00a0A practitioner in orofacial pain needs a strong background in the basic and applied pain sciences.\u00a0Topics include neurology, neuroanatomy, neurological examination, behavioral medicine, neurobiology of pain, neuropathic pain, headache disorders, musculoskeletal and myofascial pain disorders, pharmacotherapeutics for pain and pain management, occlusion and TMJ disorders, sleep apnea and orofacial dystonias.\nClinic experience is hands-on following an observational, probationary period that depends on demonstrating competency. The number of patients seen by resident trainees will depend on many variables to be determined by the clinic director and staff.\u00a0Initially, more TMD patients with symptoms of arthralgia and myofascial pain may be assigned, and then the patient assignments may be expanded to more chronic pain profiles.\u00a0The UCLA program gives treatment experience of the whole spectrum of orofacial pain conditions rather than limitation to screening, diagnosis, and referral for treatment.\nResident trainees will be responsible for patient care, documentation, writing reports to referring doctors, follow-up to patient calls, and urgent care.

In this program, students develop their microscopic, clinical and critical thinking skills in a resource-rich, supportive, collegial and collaborative environment.\u00a0\n\n\n\tThe oral and maxillofacial pathology program begins with an intensive didactic curriculum lasting 1 to 1.5 years that provides a broad understanding of the pathophysiology and behavior of disease and a strong theoretical background in the area of students\u2019 research interests. All students are expected to complete oral biology core courses at HSDM. In addition, based on the research interest of each individual, students are required to take elective basic science courses offered at Harvard Medical School, the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Each student must demonstrate competency in statistical methods by successful completion of a course in biostatistics at HSDM.\n\n\n\tClinical training in oral and maxillofacial pathology includes two components: diagnostic histopathology and patient care. Students receive rigorous histopathology training in oral, head and neck, and general pathology. They also learn to diagnose and treat patients with mucosal diseases in block rotations at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. Students are encouraged to take the fellowship examination in the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology by the end of third year and all are expected to take the board examination at the end of training. Students are also encouraged to take the Fellowship examination offered by the American Academy of Oral Medicine.\n\n\n\tResearch is required of all advanced graduate students in this program. For the MMSc degree, all students are required to write a research proposal in NIH format as part of their didactic requirement in their first year. For the DMSc degree, students are required to successfully write and defend an original thesis based on independent research. This research may be performed at any of the laboratories in the Longwood Medical Area, where students work with nationally- and internationally-renowned researchers, and are mentored by the principal investigators in those laboratories.\n\n\n\tAll students are encouraged from the first year to familiarize themselves with the scope of research opportunities available to Harvard postdoctoral students and they are given opportunities to identify a project that is suited to their individual interests and needs. By the middle of the second year, students are expected to identify a research mentor and to begin their research activities. Research occupies an increasing portion of the students\u2019 time after the beginning of the third year, but students will continue to participate in histopathology sign-out and histopathology seminar. Costs of research equipment, reagents, and facilities are funded through the support mechanisms of the research sponsors. Students are also encouraged to present their research at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.\n\n\n\tWe believe that effective teaching is both a science and art. An outstanding teacher must study and practice teaching as well as the subject matter of their discipline in order to achieve excellence. Thus, students in the program are encouraged to learn about effective teaching pedagogy and techniques. They are involved in teaching some undergraduate courses and in teaching OMP to oral medicine residents and graduate students. \u00a0Students give presentations to faculty and peers throughout the year during Oral Medicine Grand Rounds and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital Plastic and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Grand Rounds. Students also moderate discussion groups in all of the courses that are taught by the division.

In the past, resident have been involved in programs in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Peru and Ecuador.\nOsseointegrated Implants: Residents are extensively involved in treatment planning / surgical placement of osseointegrated implants, and all adjunctive surgical procedures, at UConn Health and Hartford Hospital. In addition, a monthly Implant Conference is held at UConn Health in conjunction with the Departments of Periodontics and Prosthodontics.\nAnesthesia/Sedation: Residents are comprehensively trained in the administration of deep sedation/general anesthesia, including 4 months rotating on the University of Connecticut Anesthesia Service, acting as an Anesthesia resident at the respective teaching institutions. Residents administer approximately 600 deep sedation/general anesthetics annually.\nDentoalveolar: Extensive, comprehensive exposure to the diagnosis, preoperative planning, and performance of surgical extractions/preprosthetic surgery occurs on a daily basis in each teaching institution.\nResearch Requirements\nAn important and required part of the resident educational experience at the University of Connecticut Affiliated Program is submission of an abstract for the Annual AAOMS Scientific Session and preparation of a paper suitable for publication. The abstract must be submitted by April 1 of the year prior to completion of the program and the paper completed by the middle of the final year of the program. The abstract and paper may be a report of cases with literature review, a description of a new technique, an essay dealing with any significant aspect of oral and maxillofacial surgery, a report based on a research project, or any other topic approved by the faculty.\nBecause of the necessary deadlines, it is essential that each resident choose a topic during the second year. The subject of the paper should be discussed with the assigned faculty advisor. The project does not need to be performed with the assigned advisor; it can be done under the supervision of others among the faculty and attending surgeons community-wide; however, it is the resident\u2019s responsibility to keep the assigned advisor informed of progress on the paper.\nThe project must progress to the point that by April 1 prior to the year of program completion an abstract can be prepared and submitted for presentation at the Annual AAOMS meeting; attendance at the meeting is contingent upon the submission of an abstract. The final manuscript for submission for publication will be completed by January 30 of the final year.\nThere are two main opportunities for research projects. First, residents may participate in ongoing faculty research projects. Second, the resident with a strong interest in a specific project will be encouraged to design such a project and will receive faculty support of his/her clinical or laboratory experimental endeavors.\n*Obtaining a badge from UConn Health is mandatory and required in order to be enrolled. This process includes a full background check. Badges are subject to approval from UConn Police and the Risk Management Office.\u00a0\nThe vast majority of the thirty-six oral and maxillofacial surgery faculty are Diplomates of the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Faculty from other departments within the Schools of Dental Medicine and Medicine, as well as staff members of the affiliated hospitals, participate fully in the residency program.\nDivision Chair\nDavid M.

Interns enrolled in the program will rotate through Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine, Boston Medical Center, and other affiliate institutions, and their clinical responsibilities are similar to the categorical PGY1 residents enrolled in the OMS residency program.\n\u00a0\nGoals\nTo provide trainees a live experience of hospital-based resident training and an in-depth understanding of the PGY 1 level expectations. On completion, graduates should possess sufficient professional knowledge, skills, and ability to practice minor oral surgery competently and independently. They will also become familiar with contemporary hospital-based, academic OMS practice and the daily life of an OMS resident. The intent of this program is also to strengthen the interns subsequent application for a formal OMS residency training program by providing a diverse clinical experience and adequate opportunity for relevant research.\n\u00a0\nAnnual Openings\nOral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery Pre-Residency Internship Program: maximum of two openings\n\u00a0\nTuition\nBoston University Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine charges tuition to all interns entering the preliminary internship program. Scholarship is awarded at the discretion of the program director to offset tuition requirements for select individuals.\n\u00a0\nHousing\nHelp with housing for the incoming interns is available through BMC and BU. The BMC House Officers Association prepares information about the neighborhood and transportation most accessible to the core hospitals, and maintains a list of apartments and houses that will be vacated by current house officers in June. This list is available to new residents in late April. In addition, BUMC\u2019s Off-Campus Services Office provides valuable information on housing.\nStipend\nAnnual stipends are available for interns accepted into the program. This stipend is equivalent to the stipend offered to categorical OMS PGY1 residents by the graduate medical education department.\nApplication Information\nVisit the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine postdoctoral admissions website for application instructions.\nThe Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Pre-Residency Internship Program uses the ADEA Post-doctoral Application Support Service (PASS) for admissions. An online application \u00a0is available.\nInterviews for the Pre-Residency Internship Program are usually conducted after the match results are out for the oral and maxillofacial surgery 4- and 6-year OMS Residency programs. Although applications for this after the Match are considered, early applications are encouraged. The internship program does not participate in the National Matching program.\nThis program is only open to graduates of CODA-accredited, US and Canadian Dental Schools.

This is an excellent program for those dentists who are interested in becoming oral and maxillofacial surgeons, but who desire further experience prior to beginning a formal residency training program. The intern receives similar education, training, and responsibilities as that of an oral and maxillofacial surgery resident in the first year of a six-year program (please refer to\u00a0Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Residency\u00a0program). However, this one-year program cannot be counted toward completion of a formal certificate program.\nThe internship offers strong clinical training, covering the full scope of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Surgical cases are performed in the operating rooms of the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. A considerable component of training is devoted to the presentation of clinically-oriented basic scientific material.\nIntegrated with the superb clinic training, strong didactic teaching is also emphasized in the curriculum. The scientific background of oral and maxillofacial surgical practice is featured in seminars, lectures, and conferences throughout the year. Lecture courses are offered in the areas of internal medicine, physical diagnosis, oral pathology, head and neck radiation therapy, dental implantology, and head and neck anatomy (including clinically relevant cadaveric dissection).\nSelected candidates will be invited to interview.

The program is\u00a0ONLY\u00a0open to graduates of CODA-accredited US and Canadian dental schools accredited by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association. The admission criteria for the 6-year track is similar to the 4-year CAGS program with the exception being that all applicants must also have a US or Canadian undergraduate college degree. The MD-integrated track includes sponsorship for USMLE examinations. The requirements for medical licensure differ from state to state. Applicants are encouraged to review each state\u2019s requirement for medical licensure. The\u00a0Federation of State Medical Boards\u00a0(http://www.fsmb.org/) has a complete listing of medical boards within the continental United States. Completion of the OMFS-MD program does not guarantee licensure in any state. All applicants\u00a0MUST\u00a0forward official results from the National Dental Boards Part I to the postdoctoral admissions office as part of their application. \u00a0It is\u00a0required\u00a0that applicants also forward scores from the AAOMS-sponsored National Board of Medical Examiners\u00ae (NBME\u00ae) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) as part of their application. Selection into the program is extremely competitive and preference is given to applicants with high academic achievement and an aptitude for oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nThe program is designed to provide the resident with sufficient didactic and clinical education to meet the requirements of the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and to become a proficient practitioner. All residents are extremely well prepared for careers in clinical practice, both in academic and private practice settings. Residents are encouraged to develop skills in teaching and clinical research in preparation for an academic career.\nGraduates of non-US or -Canadian accredited schools are\u00a0NOT eligible to apply for the 6-year OMFS-MD residency program. They may apply for the one-year\u00a0Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Internship program.\nGoals\nNationally, there has been a long-standing trend for US OMFS residency programs to offer a concurrent MD degree through an affiliated medical school. The addition of the MD component to traditional OMFS programs provides select residents additional education, training and credentials commensurate with the expanding range and complexity of their surgical repertoire.\nThe goals of both the 4-year and 6-year oral and maxillofacial surgery residency programs are to provide residents with excellent didactic and clinical experience. On completion of either program, graduates will possess sufficient professional knowledge, skills, and ability to practice competently and independently. Residents are extremely well-prepared to meet the requirement of the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\u00a0\nCurriculum and Rotations\n\nClick image to enlarge.\nIn the 6-year track, matriculated residents spend the first month on the OMFS service along with the 4-year track PGY-1 residents. This time is spent being oriented to the hospital, to resident life, and a significant amount of time is devoted to gaining an introduction to clinical medicine (learning to take a history and perform full body physical examination). At the end of this month, the 6-year track residents enter in to the 2nd year of medical school (advanced standing). They spend the remainder of this year and the next year fully integrated in the medical school (Years 1 and 2 of the program). The two full years in medical school are at the level of 2nd year (aimed to augment basic and clinical science didactic knowledge and physical diagnosis skills) and 3rd year (required clinical rotations required for MD-degree). The third year of the MD-integrated program is a \u201chybrid year\u201d; enrolled residents complete 4 months of medical rotations (required for the MD degree), spend 4 months on anesthesia which is followed by 8 months on the OMFS service. In May of this third year, the resident will have completed requirements of the MD-degree. The 4th year of the program fulfills the requirements of general surgery and the remaining anesthesia requirements besides providing additional time on the OMFS service as a junior resident During the 5th and 6th years of training, residents are fully on the OMFS service (24 months on-service) concurrent with the final 2 years of the 4-year track residents. This gives a total of 33 months on the OMFS service in the 6-year track (1 in the 1st year, 4 in the 3rd year, 4 in the 4th year, 24 in the 5th and 6th years) compared to 34 months in the 4-year track (10 in 1st year, 24 months in 3rd and 4th year) assuring a comparable experience.\nOral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery Training Curriculum\nBesides the medical school curriculum, residents in the 6-year MD integrated program will participate in all didactic activities and education of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery department. This includes the following specific courses and seminars which they will receive during their on-service (OMFS) ROTATIONS:\nYear 1:\nYEARS 3, 4, 5, AND 6:\nCourses\nAn ongoing review of the classic and current literature in oral and maxillofacial surgery and related disciplines.

Having completed one, I can assure you that\u2019s quite true. Training is never easy. There are good days and then there are some not so good days. If I could give the readers of this testimonial, one mantra to live by in residency, it would be to \u201ckeep the eye on the prize and never lose sight of your goal.\u201d Trust me, your daily routine in training, will make you question your choices and it\u2019ll make you forget the pure joy you felt when you matched to your program. But as I said, keep the eye on the prize, rise above and remember to look at the big picture.\nMy time in training was spent at (dare I say) a \u201cbusy\u201d program. I will be ever thankful to those who made my experience most cherishable, despite the rigors of the day - my faculty that taught me (and disciplined me when I was losing sight of the prize), my co-residents that made the experience fun and whose company brightened my every day, the hospital and clinic staff that we got to know (and value) like family and most importantly our patients, who made it all worth it.\nAt Maryland, you\u2019ll be trained by prolific and highly specialized surgeons, in a setting that is world class and where the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery team is highly respected. And speaking of the city, Baltimore (things have changed since The Wire dropped guys!) will grow on you and some of you might even consider making it your home!\nAll in all, if you have the opportunity of training at Maryland, consider it a privilege, take it all in and become a \u201ccitizen surgeon.\u201d You not only have it in you, these guys will also get it out of you!\"\n\u00a0\nHether Khosa, BDS\nClinical Instructor\nDivision of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery (Department of Surgery)\nUniversity of Cincinnati\nEmail: hether88@gmail.com, khosahr@ucmail.uc.edu\n\u00a0\nWelcome to the University of Maryland Department of Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery Residency webpage.

The final 24 months are spent on the OMFS service.\nThe first year is spent on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery service, divided between the Veteran's Hospital, the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center, and the College of Dentistry. Courses include Physical Diagnosis, Oral Pathology, and Anesthesia/Conscious Sedation. Residents present cases before staff and students in teaching rounds, attend weekly conferences.\nOMFS residents begin medical school in July and complete the second and third years of medical school. Residents have no \"on-service\" responsibilities during their medical school training. The medical degree is awarded after successful completion of the USMLE parts 1 and 2; this is a requirement of the program. The fourth year of residency is a PGY-1 medical year during which the residents rotate through general surgical and anesthesia services.\nThe final two years of training are spent back on the OMFS service, and advanced operative experience is gained both in the clinic and in the operating room. Residents are encouraged to participate in scholarly pursuits throughout the entirety of their residency. During the sixth year, residents function as Administrative Chief for a four-month block. The Chief Resident is responsible for the daily operations of the service, the call schedule, conference schedules, and management of clinic and hospital patients as assigned by the faculty.\nResidents provide patient care in a number of outpatient and inpatient facilities including the Chandler Medical Center, UK College of Dentistry,\u00a0Veteran's Administration Hospital, and the University of Kentucky Children's Hospital. The Division of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery has scheduled operating time across these facilities from Monday through Friday. This provides residents graduated experience in managing more complex maxillofacial injuries and elective surgical cases. The UK College of Dentistry provides residents with experience in routine and complex dentoalveolar surgery and anesthesia on an outpatient basis. Residents also assist with the supervision of dental students in managing and treating walk-in and scheduled patients. There are 12 operatories in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic located in the UK College of Dentistry and a two-chair operatory in the Veteran's Administration Clinic. The VA Hospital provides residents with experience in outpatient dentoalveolar surgery, dental implants, the surgical management of head and neck skin pathology in an elderly, as well as\u00a0with a medically compromised patient population.\nThe Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery service is responsible for Maxillofacial Trauma call every third night, rotating with the Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery services.

Within our main campus, we have 3 outpatient centers that serve the population of the Bronx. \u00a0We have an operating room and admitting privileges at five hospitals, Montefiore Hospital, Wakefield Hospital, Weiler Hospital, St. Barnabas Hospital, and Jersey City Medical Center.\u00a0 In 2018, the Montefiore OMFS division alone had over 35,000 outpatient visits, over 350 operating room cases, over 4500 cases of intravenous sedation and placement of over 3500 dental implants.\nAt Montefiore, you work closely with faculty and your co-residents. \u00a0Within our department, we have daily interaction with our general practice, prosthodontics, pediatric and orthodontic programs. \u00a0Within the hospital, we have a close working relationship with the ENT, Plastics and Head and Neck surgical subspecialties. Since Montefiore has no undergraduate dental students, our five full-time faculty members devote their time exclusively to the graduate residents. Intra-specialty cooperation is the norm at Montefiore.\nThe program has high standards for academic achievement and learning. In addition to a program of hospital rounds, weekly conferences, formal courses in physical diagnosis and oral pathology, you are sponsored by the department to complete a comprehensive OMFS board review course in your final year. \u00a0Residents are expected to embark on an extensive program of reading and study to include trauma, reconstruction, orthognathic and implant rehabilitation with a focus on ABOMS preparation. Weekly conferences and day-to-day interactions with the faculty allow the residents to apply their knowledge and expertise to real-world treatment. Formal lectures comprise a portion of the didactic program, but by far the majority of the teaching is done via the Socratic approach. Faculty members will be there, standing beside you in the clinic or operating room, asking questions, not in their offices preparing lectures or doing research. \u00a0In addition to the didactic program, cadaveric surgical anatomy course and orthognathic surgery courses are given each year.

The Division\u2019s research program has two thematic areas: translational regenerative medicine and the discovery of the genetic etiology of craniofacial and dentofacial disorders.\nFaculty of the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery are involved in the didactic teaching of the physical diagnosis course, the pathophysiology course, and the maxillofacial surgery, local anesthesia, pain and anxiety control, and oral facial pain courses. The Division also provides clinical education in our dental clinics.\nThe Division offers two NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital residency programs: The General Practice Residency\u00a0and the Oral and Maxillofacial/MD Residency. The General Practice Residency offers residents a training program in comprehensive multidisciplinary oral health care at a level of skill and complexity beyond that achieved in predoctoral training. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery/MD Residency provides training in the full scope of oral and maxillofacial surgery while meeting the requirements of the Commission of Dental Accreditation.\nThe Division offers a 2 to 4 week Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Externship\u00a0for dental students who are interested in pursuing a career in oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nPatient care is provided in our out-patient OMFS Teaching Clinic, and at ColumbiaDoctors Dentistry. In-patient care is provided at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the Morgan Stanley Children\u2019s Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian.\nOur full-time faculty are practicing dentists and surgeons with ColumbiaDoctors Dentistry, the faculty practice of the College of Dental Medicine. The faculty practice provides the full scope of oral and maxillofacial surgery including correction of jaw deformities (orthognathic surgery), cleft lip and palate and craniofacial surgery, pediatric oral and maxillofacial surgery, maxillofacial pathology and reconstruction, dentoalveolar and dental implant surgery. Board certified faculty provide care for patients with trauma, sleep disordered breathing, and those with oral mucosal and salivary gland diseases. Dental care is available for developmentally disabled, geriatric, and medically compromised patients.\nThe Center for Oral, Facial and Head Pain\u00a0provides both consultative and treatment services to patients. Faculty are also integrated members of the Craniofacial Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital.\nFaculty at the Regenerative Engineering Laboratory\u00a0are involved in research focused on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, with emphasis on urgent clinical needs, innovation, feasibility, and translation. We are specifically interested in musculoskeletal/craniofacial regeneration by harnessing endogenous stem/progenitor cells using advanced scaffolds (e.g. 3D printed constructs), control-delivery system, and/or translational animal models. Current target tissues include, but are not limited to, tendons/ligaments, knee meniscus, articular cartilage, and temporomandibular joint.\nOur other thematic area is in the elucidation of the genetic etiology of dentofacial and craniofacial disorders.

The pro\u00adgram, which accommodates one resident each year, offers sequential training in the full scope of Oral and Maxillofacial procedures. Some areas of excellence associated with the training program are:\nAll members of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery house staff participate in various conferences and meetings when on service. Each year, an Oral and Maxillofacial Sur\u00adgery In-Service Training Examination (OMSITE) is administered to each of the residents in order to assist both the residents and the program in assessing their respective strengths and weaknesses. At least one published paper or abstract is a requirement of individ\u00adual members of the house staff, and we provide the opportunity to engage in a clini\u00adcal research project, which we strongly encourage. Upon the successful completion of the program, the resident will be certified as Board-eligible in the specialty of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs you begin your training as a first year resident, you will be clinically responsible for learning outpatient, inpatient, and o\u00ad\u00adperating room protocols. Additionally, your academic focus will be on learning the basic skills necessary to attain proficiency in outpatient care and on-call responsibilities by observing and performing both outpatient and operating room procedures. You will participate in all conferences, lectures, staff meetings, and finish the year with your first off-service rotation in anesthesiology that will continue into the start of your second year. Your first year didactic program will consist of a comprehensive course in Physical Diagnosis (sponsored by the Department of Medicine and the Stony Brook Medical School).\nAs a second year resident, you spend your first 7 months off service completing rotations in anesthesiology and medicine. When rotating through the Department of Anesthesiology, you will administer various anesthetics to surgical patients on a daily basis, intubate patients, acquire skills in medical risk assessment, and gain knowledge in the principles of general anesthesia (including physiology, anatomy, and pharmacology). During your two-month rotation through the Department of Medicine, your scope will include diagnostic and therapeutic modalities administered to patients with multi-systems failure who are in need of acute and intensive medical care. When you are back on service, you will apply your knowledge and skills more independently via administration of pre-, intra-, and post-operative care as well as beginning to provide intravenous outpatient sedation.\nAs a third year resident, you assume increased responsibilities and conduct intravenous outpatient sedation cases in the OMFS clinic. In the second half of this year, you will complete rotations in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Department of Trauma, and Department of Surgery. In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit your education will be directed towards the acute diagnostic and therapeutic care rendered to the traumatized and critically injured patient. When rotating through the Trauma Department, your focus will be on evaluating, treating, and managing patients in the emergent setting with a wide variety of traumatic injuries. During the rotation in the Department of Surgery, you will obtain skills in the care and management of the multiple-trauma patient, emergency room triage, management and care of the head and neck patient, as well as other multidisciplinary approaches to patient care.\nIn your chief year, you will take on major responsibilities such as supervising and coordinating a large portion of the clinical and didactic activities. The chief resident will spend the year honing his/her skills by performing major oral and maxillofacial procedures across a broad scope while taking on the leadership responsibilities of disseminating knowledge to other residents via conferences, rounds, and structured didactic programs. As the chief resident, you will also rotate for a total of two months at the private affiliate hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center and participate in procedures at NYU Winthrop University Hospital in order to broaden elective case exposures.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVictor Nannini, DDS \u2013 full-time\n\u00a0\nOren Richman, DDS, MD \u2013 full-time\n\u00a0\nRory Sadoff, DDS\n\u00a0\nClaudine Cafferata, DDS\n\u00a0\nCraig Levine, DDS\n\u00a0\nGreg Panossian, DDS\n\u00a0\nMarieange Panossian, DDS, MD\n\u00a0\nKenneth Paticoff, DDS\n\u00a0\nMichael Schwartz, DDS\n\u00a0\nBrian Wolf, DMD\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nChief\u00a0| Cody Mumma, DDS\n\u00a0\n\nPGY-3 | Jonathan Morcos, DDS\n\u00a0\nPGY-2 | Jessica Li, DDS\n\u00a0\n\nPGY-1 | Joshua Lilly, DDS\n\u00a0\nJessica Carney, on behalf of:\nDr. Victor Nannini\nDirector, Advanced Training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery\nNassau University Medical Center\nBox # 72\n2201 Hempstead Turnpike\nEast Meadow, NY 11554\nTelephone: (516) 572-6895\nTelephone: (516) 572-8774\nFacsimile: (516) 572-5379\nEmail: jcarney@numc.edu\n\u00a0\nWe are offering hands-off observership opportunities at this time.

It is a 338-bed\u00a0hospital servicing the East Harlem community. Residents while assigned here benefit primarily from a busy outpatient clinic and a new surgicenter for sedations. The site offers digital panoramic, cephalometric and direct digital intraoral dental imaging, CBCT, and digital medical imaging, plus electronic dental and medical records and an electronic practice management system. The 24-month training experience includes working directly with a surgical orthodontist on significant reconstructive surgical procedures in the areas of dental implants and grafting. In addition, on average, the trainees receive block operating room time 2 days per week. The assigned third year senior resident functions as the lead resident and gains commensurate experience as a primary surgeon and familiarity with running a service prior to their fourth year.\nWestchester Medical Center\u00a0(WMC) is located on the Grasslands Reservation off the Sprain Brook Parkway in Valhalla, New York; New York Medical College School of Medicine is adjacent to the academic medical center on the Valhalla campus (~20 miles north of New York City). WMC is a 652-bed tertiary care Level 1 Trauma Center located in Westchester County serving the 7 county Hudson Valley region. The facility provides residents with 24 months of advanced surgical experience treating facial trauma, pathology, facial reconstruction, and cosmetic surgery in the operating room, as well as, the associated management of inpatients. In 2017, WMC completed a new, state of the art Dental/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery surgicenter for exclusive use by the program, which includes five operatories, two of which are dedicated solely to the OMFS program. While on service at WMC, residents have dedicated operating room days to focus on their surgical experience. In the clinical environment, residents complete a wide scope of outpatient oral and maxillofacial surgery including dental alveolar surgery, dental implants, Botox/filers, and routine IV sedation/general anesthesia. Residents work closely with experienced general practitioners for complex implant treatment plans and prosthetic reconstruction.\u00a0\nThe four year Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) program is sponsored by New York Medical College School of Medicine (NYMC SOM). The program accepts two candidates each academic year. A certificate is presented to those candidates who successfully complete the program. In addition, the program offers an\u00a0M.D. Option\u00a0at\u00a0NYMC SOM to those qualified residents who successfully complete the OMFS program. The program is designed to provide clinical, didactic, and hospital experience at the postdoctoral level in OMFS, as well as scholarly activities. The residents will utilize two clinical training sites of New York Medical College School of Medicine for their clinical activity. These include NYC H+H/Metropolitan and Westchester Medical Center (WMC).\u00a0The Standards for Advanced Specialty Education Program in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the American Dental Association are the underlying basis for the OMS program with the expectation of graduates becoming Certified by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\nAs a resident within the New York Medical College School of Medicine (NYMC SOM) Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program, you will truly practice a broad scope of OMFS. For example, as a third-year resident, you will work one on one with an orthodontist for orthognathic surgery treatment planning. Having an attending that is fellowship trained in cosmetic advanced orthognathic, not only allows extensive experience but also grants experience with advanced orthognathic and its effect on facial cosmetics. Being the only level I trauma center with a reach that expands across 5,000 square miles, WMC generates an excellent experience with facial trauma. While rotating on-call coverage at Westchester Medical Center with ENT and Plastic Surgery, residents routinely see and treat complex lacerations, orbital, midface and mandibular trauma. All the attending faculty are confident treating extensive facial trauma and allow residents ample opportunity and experience in the operating room. Sedations are a mainstay at both clinical training sites and residents of the program are confident in their ability to perform outpatient sedation.\u00a0\nBoth clinical training sites are associated with the NYMC SOM General Dental Practice Residency program (GPR) that actively provides referrals from their patients for surgical procedures. The GPR residents provide a valuable opportunity to work together for implant treatment planning.\u00a0\nIn conjunction with a robust clinical experience, the residency program provides a solid didactic curriculum. It is comprised of weekly didactic lectures, seminars, interdisciplinary conferences, workshops, and surgical anatomy lab. The didactic curriculum is complemented with the attendance at a variety of local and regional meetings and continuing education programs supported by the department. Likewise, the faculty and department support the resident's participation in scholarly activities such as clinical research and manuscript preparation.\u00a0\nRotations by year\nApplications for Residency beginning July 1, 2022 will be accepted through ADEA Postdoctoral Application Support Service (PASS) beginning in Summer 2021; we will accept (2) two applicants to the four-year program. Applicants must graduate from a US or Canadian dental school and must be US citizens and US permanent residents.

Having a diverse patient population, being a Level-1 trauma center, and having a large faculty with varying clinical interests allows the program to provide training consistent with that goal. In addition, all of our clinical facilities are equipped for full-scale general anesthesia including a clinic-based ambulatory operating room.\nMajor inpatient surgical procedures during a recent typical year:\nAt least one-half day per week is designated for the chief resident and third-year residents to see pre-op implant patients, perform implant placement, sinus lift procedures, and soft and hard tissue preprosthetic operations. This dedicated time ensures that each resident can follow their implant patients all the way from consult to surgery to restoration. A faculty member with advanced implant experience supervises this clinic and provides expertise in implants.\nMajor cosmetic surgery is performed in our clinic on a regular basis. The cases are done under local anesthesia, IV sedation or intubated general anesthesia, depending on the length and complexity of the procedure. The entire spectrum of facial cosmetic surgery, including, facelifts, browlifts, eyelid surgery, otoplasty, Botox injections, cosmetic skin resurfacing, and cosmetic augmentation procedures, are done by chief and third-year residents under the supervision of faculty who are credentialed by the State Board to do such procedures. During this clinic session, pre and postoperative patients are also seen in conjunction with the attending surgeon staffing the clinic.\nOne-half day per week is designated for orthognatic surgery evaluations and postoperative care patients. All levels of residents are involved with this clinic. A full-time faculty member who is involved in treating these orthognathic surgery patients supervises the residents.\nOnce a month, an upper level resident and a faculty member see TMJ surgical patients for initial evaluation, re-evaluation and post- operative follow up at the Hospital Clinic. In addition, when an upper level resident is on the intramural Faculty Practice rotation, they gain additional experience in the management of these patients. The residents gain ample skills and learn the techniques to postoperative manage these patients in addition to their operating room surgical experience.\nA separate TMJ clinic exists within the department for the nonsurgical management of TMJ patients. The residents have an optional rotation in these clinics early in their training.\nOn a biweekly basis, all patients treated for facial soft tissue and bone trauma are seen by the residents and a faculty member with an interest and expertise in the management of such cases. Assessment of postoperative complications and the need for additional reconstructive or cosmetic procedures is done during these clinic sessions.\nOne upper level resident (a third year or a chief resident) is assigned to be involved in the care of private practice patients at both the faculty intramural and off-campus private practices. During this rotation, the resident gains a \u201creal world\u201d perspective on ambulatory and hospitalized minor and major oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures and develops the skills of pre- and post-operative patient care and office management skills on a one-on-one basis with private practitioners.\nAll of our residents perform a variety of anesthetic procedures in the OMFS clinic including IV anesthesia, inhalational anesthesia, LMA (Larynseal Mask Anesthetic) and endotracheal intubations.

Emphasis of the didactic program will be on providing a strong foundation in areas of biomechanics, growth and development, biology of tooth movement, cephalometrics, clinical methodology based on evidence-based knowledge, advanced treatment planning related to orthodontic treatments, and related basic research methodology. Lectures will be assigned to the Fellows,\u00a0who will in turn be mentored in teaching skills by the faculty in the Division. One to two days a week will be dedicated to this component.\nClinical Patient Care Component\nThis component will facilitate development of expertise in management of complex orthodontic patients (especially in decision-making and prioritization of treatment sequencing when the patient has multiple issues). Special focus will be placed on mechanics-based treatment approaches. There will be opportunities to master newer innovations and techniques in orthodontics that include skeletal anchorage, 3D treatment planning with CBCT technology, advanced biomechanics and orthognathic surgery. The fellows will work very closely with the faculty and residents within the orthodontics clinic. Fellows will be authorized (i.e., have privileges) to guide, educate and advise residents on various aspects of treatment.**\nOne to two days a week will be dedicated to this clinical patient care component. If the fellow is a graduate of the Orthodontics Residency at UConn Health, he/she will also have the opportunity to complete his/her board cases.\n** The fellow's clinical competency and involvement must be approved and authorized by the program director.\nResearch Component\nThis component's intent is to expose the fellow to a spectrum of basic science and clinical research programs currently in progress in the Division of Orthodontics. The fellow will be provided sufficient opportunity to work on a project of interest either in basic science or clinical research. One to two days a week will be dedicated to the research component.\nApplication Process\nPlease send questions and/or electronic application copies of the above in one email to:\nDr. Madhur Upadhyay\nDirector, Orthodontic Fellowship Program\nDivision\u00a0of Orthodontics, MC 1725\nUConn School of Dental Medicine\n263 Farmington Avenue\nFarmington, CT 06030-1725, USA\nEmail: maupadhyay@uchc.edu\nOr\nShelly Gioia-Morelli\nAdministrative Program Coordinator\nDivision\u00a0of Orthodontics\nUConn School of Dental Medicine\n263 Farmington Avenue\nFarmington, CT 06030-1725\nPhone: 860-679-2550\nEmail: gioiamorelli@uchc.edu\nFull-Time Faculty\nFlavio Uribe, D.D.S., M.D.S.\nAssociate Professor\nProgram Director and Division Chair\nCharles J.

Initially, the student is introduced to the preventive aspects of dental care in children. Dental care prevention is especially stressed, including the use of systemic and topical fluorides, occlusal sealant application, and diet modification. Restorative care and appliance therapy for children are also taught with equal emphasis placed upon the technical aspects of treatment and treatment rationale. The development of occlusion from the prenatal period through adolescence is presented, and what constitutes a normal occlusion is described. Students learn to recognize malocclusion, identify the concomitant etiologic factors, and are taught to prevent, intercept or treat minor problems of the occlusion. The didactic program continues in the third year with an emphasis on behavior management in children, orthodontic considerations for the adult patient, and literature review. Clinical sessions in children's dentistry begin in the student's second year with bimonthly sessions and increase to two half-day sessions/week in the third year. Students provide comprehensive care to infants, children, and adolescents including those who require extensive needs or exhibit behavioral concerns. Emphasis is on risk assessment, treatment planning, and the application of therapies best designed to optimize the potential oral health of the individual patient and their family.\u00a0 Students also participate with faculty and residents in community outreach programs that are coordinated throughout their second and third years.\n\nFor those students who have an interest in furthering their experiences with pediatric patients, the department offers selectives to fourth-year students both at the school and at affiliated institutions. This program allows students to strengthen their pediatric dentistry skills through a weekly rotation during their fourth year. In addition, these elite individuals gain worthwhile experience on the clinic floor working closely with faculty and teaching underclassmen.

Orthodontics is a rewarding and challenging career that offers a wealth of benefits, including building relationships with patients, exercising creativity in daily work, working as part of a team, and helping to eliminate oral health disparities. Many orthodontists own their own businesses and every day have the privilege of transforming their patients\u2019 lives by improving their oral health.\nComprehensive Physical Diagnosis and Treatment Planning, Craniofacial Growth and Development, Dentofacial Deformities, Orthodontic and Endodontic/Periodontic/Prosthodontic/Surgical Interaction, Principles of Mechanics, Research, Temporomandibular Disorders and Orofacial Pain\nCritical thinking and problem-solving, clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, clinical hand skills (fine motor skills), patient communication, practice management and research.\nPrivate Practice, Practice Owner, Public Health (public health agencies, community health clinics and schools), Research, Teaching\nApplicant Eligibility Students accepted for postgraduate training in orthodontics must have a professional dental degree from an ADA-accredited college or school or from a non-U.S./Canadian students dental college or school. Provisional acceptance may be offered to candidates in the final stages of dental education.\nSelection Factors Preference is given to those who have adequate preparation and aptitude. Applications for the program are considered on the basis of the following factors:\nApplicants from countries where English is not the native language are required to score a minimum of 550 (paper-based) or 213 (computer-based) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) to be eligible to apply for admission. Non-U.S. applicants must submit a financial data sheet.\nApplicant Process\nThe didactic and clinical curricula are designed to allow an individual to develop skills required of the practicing orthodontist. ADA CODA approval granted as of February 1, 2008.\nStudents must concurrently enroll in, and complete, the master of science degree program. \nMaster's Program A requirement for the attainment of a certificate of specialization in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics is the completion of the requirements for a master of science degree.\nThe program leading to a M.S. degree is awarded by the Graduate College through the College of Dentistry in the Medical Sciences Interdepartmental Area (MSIA) graduate program. The program consists of expanded course-work, the conduct of an approved research project, the submission of a formal thesis and of a publishable article to a refereed journal. The program usually requires a minimum of 30 months to complete.\nThe M.S. degree program is administrated by the Graduate College and is not administratively related to the certificate program; there is no clinical component, and extra course work may be required depending on the student's area of study. However, the certificate of specialization program completion is contingent on completion of a M.S. degree program.\nAn application to the Graduate College for the M.S. program must be completed by the student to take the graduate degree program concurrently. Applicants are required to seek a graduate degree (M.S. or Ph.D.) so they must meet the admission requirements of the Graduate College and the MSIA Program.\u00a0\nPh.D. Program A program may be designed that combines a certificate and a Ph.D. through the Medical Sciences Interdepartmental Area in one of the participating departments, such as Oral Biology. Extra time will be needed to meet the requirements of the Ph.D. degree. This program is structured for an individual planning on a full-time career in academics and research.\nIn addition to the program of study required by the Postgraduate Education Committee, the following are expected to be satisfactorily completed during the training program and prior to the granting of the Certificate of Specialization in Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics.\nProfessional Presentations During the Spring Semester of the first year, each student will be required to present at the annual session of the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO).

Each entering student must verify at the time of matriculation that he or she has completed the accepted routine of vaccinations. An immunization record is required in order for the student to be registered. Anyone born after 1957 is required to have two measles shots to assure immunity, with the second one given after 1980.\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Each student is required to be certified and maintain certification in basic CPR. A copy of the valid certification in basic CPR must be maintained at the College of Dentistry.\nStipendGraduate Medical Education (GME) funding allocations by UNMC must be established before resident stipends for the year can be established.\u00a0Residents will be assigned a 1.0 FTE status which makes them eligible for a flexible benefit package which includes choices among health, life and disability insurance. Future income is contingent upon continued availability of federal funds and, therefore, is subject to change at any time.\nTuition ScholarshipsGME-eligible postgraduate students are considered full-time employees of the University and, as such, are eligible for employee tuition scholarships for graduate credit hours. This permits the GME-eligible student to enroll for up to 15 credit hours per year. No more than 6 credit hours may be taken in each of the fall and spring semesters, and three credit hours may be taken in the summer. Established postgraduate fees for the postgraduate program will continue.\nStudent Loans and Loan DefermentPostgraduate students are considered students of the College of Dentistry for financial aid purposes.

The postgraduate student must document efforts to obtain licensure to the Postgraduate Admissions Office by July 15. Failure to obtain Nebraska Dental License and federal and state DEA licenses by October 15 may result in a reduction of duties and reduction or elimination of stipend.\nIt is possible for a student who has graduated from an ADA-accredited (American or Canadian) dental school to obtain a temporary Nebraska dental license during the time he or she is enrolled as a full time postgraduate student. The temporary license is only for practice-related activities within the College of Dentistry and does not allow extramural private practice. After acceptance into the postgraduate program, licensure information may be obtained from the State of Nebraska Department of Health, Bureau of Examining Boards.\nFor a regular license, the State Board accepts the results of the clinical examination given by the Central Regional Dental Testing Service. The State Board also has provisions for licensure by credentials for individuals licensed in other states.\nIn accordance with University policy, UNMC prohibits the denial of admission or of Medical Center privileges to students or applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability or religious or political beliefs. These privileges include but are not limited to admission, class assignments, scholarships, fellowships, assistantships, and financial aid, as well as housing and recreational facilities. Furthermore, student organizations must base their selection of students for membership in criteria which will not include race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.\nAdmittance to UNMC programs will not be denied to otherwise qualified disabled individuals solely by reason of their disability.

Along with competency in the traditional areas of the specialty, the program offers strong didactic and clinical orthodontic components to increase residents\u2019 skills in this area.\nPediatric Dentistry residents rotate through various clinical areas within the UCLA Health System that include the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, and the UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital to gain expertise in pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, and the management of children with special needs such as those with chronic diseases and developmental disabilities.\nThrough the Community Access, Reach and Education in Pediatric Dentistry (CARE-PD) program, residents receive traditional didactic and clinical training in pediatric dentistry, which ensures they are adept at providing comprehensive oral health care to infants and children through adolescence. Additionally, residents complete academic courses introducing them to the multiple factors that cause oral disease. Residents apply what they have learned through community-based clinical training, and practicum activities, like experience with community groups to support the oral health issues of children and advocate at the local, state, and national levels for public health policy legislation particularly for underserved populations.\nMultiple levels of competencies are developed through a systems-based training program where residents practice advocating at the individual, family, community, and policy levels to promote oral health. Instruction is provided through the academic facilities and faculty at the UCLA School of Dentistry and the UCLA Health System.\u00a0\nFor additional information about the Community Access, Reach and Education in Pediatric Dentistry (CARE-PD) component of the program, click here.A research project involving the collection and analysis of data resulting in a final comprehensive report of publishable quality is required to complete the program.

Graduates leave SLU prepared to be astute and aware clinicians using an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to caring for craniofacial and dental patient problems.\nSaint Louis University's orthodontic program offers three basic areas of training: an extensive and comprehensive clinical experience that involves diagnosis, treatment planning, active treatment and retention of patients representing a variety of malocclusions and craniofacial deformities; core courses that include biomedical sciences and clinical concepts; and orthodontic research. Students will need to complete 88 credits to graduate.\nSpecific courses include facial development, biomechanics, clinical cephalometrics, oral biology, surgical orthodontics, orthodontic problems related to the cleft-palate patient, speech problems related to the oral mechanism, history of orthodontics, diagnosis and treatment planning, clinical diagnosis, orthodontic analysis and treatment modalities, introduction to clinical orthodontics, principles of orthodontic techniques, seminar on child and adolescent psychology, digital orthodontics, scenario-based case analysis, orthodontic business management, review for the ABO examination and thesis research.\nFollowing preliminary laboratory and classroom instruction, each resident in the orthodontic program initiates treatment on a large number of patients who present a broad array of dental malocclusions and skeletal deformities. Although residents are first introduced to the Tweed edgewise philosophy form of treatment, students are also exposed to Tip-Edge mechanics (the sequel to Begg therapy), functional and other removable appliances, and various straight wire appliances. The supervising faculty members\u00a0present their philosophies and techniques by means of lectures, seminars, laboratory exercises and demonstrations.\nIn the clinic, students are exposed to a wide array of patient types. Children, adolescents and adults are treated; consequently, students are exposed to treatment in the deciduous, mixed and adult dentitions. Students are also exposed to cases with compromised oral health that require consideration of periodontal, restorative and temporomandibular joint treatment. As a result, many patients are treated by an interdisciplinary approach with other healthcare professionals. Throughout the clinical experience, each student receives a great deal of faculty attention. The development of diagnostic and treatment skills is emphasized as a major responsibility to students.\nAdditional courses and seminars augment the clinical experience, covering the topics of diagnosis and treatment planning, cephalometrics, theoretical and practical biomechanics, oral pathology, oral medicine, multidisciplinary treatment, speech disorders, craniofacial defects with particular emphasis on cleft lip/palate rehabilitation, adolescent and adult psychology, implants, dentofacial orthopedics, surgical orthodontics, TMJ disorders, and practice management.\nStudents also receive training in research design and statistics and must conduct an original research project. This effort leads to the preparation and defense of a thesis and, subsequently, the production of a manuscript suitable for publication in a journal relating to the specialty of orthodontics. The experience of discovery provided by such research is an integral part of the graduate program, and students are expected to produce a meaningful contribution to the field of orthodontics.\nOur goal is to prepare orthodontic graduates to pursue a career with many possibilities: as a clinician with a practice limited to orthodontics, as a researcher or as a teacher of orthodontics.\nA D.D.S., D.M.D., or equivalent general dental degree is required for matriculation in this and all other Saint Louis University Center for Advanced Dental Education dental training programs.\u00a0\nAll admission policies and requirements for domestic students apply to international students along with the following:\nApplications must be completed by Sept. 1 to be considered for the orthodontic program beginning the summer semester of the following year.\nPromising applicants are invited for on-site interviews beginning in October. The orthodontic program subscribes to a national matching service and the \"tell date\" occurs in late November or early December.\nFor priority consideration for graduate assistantship, apply by Feb. 1.\u00a0\nFor more information, visit the student financial services office online at http://finaid.slu.edu. \u00a0\nThe orthodontic program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association.

This application typically opens on or after August 1.\u00a0\nAll prospective students must hold a DDS, DMD or equivalent degree from a dental school.\nAdmission criteria are applied equally to all applicants regardless of race, sex, color, national origin or religion. Minority students are encouraged to apply.\n\u00a0\nIn addition to the above items, international applicants must include the following in their PASS application:\nInternational students are required to take the TOEFL exam with a minimum of\u00a090\u00a0on the internet-based test, or the IELTS with a minimum score of 7.5. The exam score must be less than two years old.\nWhen you register for any tests, you should indicate the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate School (institution #5816) as a score recipient. If you did not specify the UNC-Chapel Hill Graduate School as a score recipient at the time of taking the test, you must promptly ask ETS to send your scores to us (institution #5816). No departmental code is required.\nApplicants should take the test no later than May to ensure that scores arrive by the application deadline, unless listed here as an exception.\nWhen requested to do so by the UNC-Chapel Hill Graduate School, international applicants must submit official academic records bearing the signature of the registrar or another academic official and either a raised or ink stamp or seal of the issuing institution. Records must be issued in the original language and be accompanied by certified English translations. International applicants must also submit verification that the degree has been awarded or a copy of the degree award.\nInternational applicants seeking admission must complete and upload an international student data form and financial certification worksheet, available here. Applicants may submit financial certificate documentation at any time during the application process or they may wait to upload the documentation until they have received your admittance notification from the UNC-Chapel Hill Graduate School. Please note these documents must be received and approved by the International Student and Scholar Services office before visa documents can be prepared.\nWe encourage applications from non-U.S. citizens and we have a proud record of international alumni Greece, Iceland, Thailand, China and more. However, financial support for international students is sparse. Typically our international students are sponsored by their native countries through government support or university scholarships. Along with their living expenses, international students must be prepared to pay tuition expenses at the level of non-North Carolina residents (see above) for three years of study and training. No stipend support or grants are available for international students unless they are U.S. citizens.\nThe cost of attending graduate school includes tuition, fees, and health insurance, for which the student is billed directly. Tuition and fees for the master\u2019s programs in the Adams School of Dentistry are available through the University Cashier.\nGraduate students must pay tuition and fees during all years of study and training. These charges are subject to change at any meeting of the NC Board of Trustees and a yearly increase of 5-10 percent should be anticipated each year. Estimates for living expenses are available through the Office of Scholarships and Student Aid.\nOut-of-state students and international students with permanent resident status (\u201cgreen card\u201d) are encouraged to establish legal residence in North Carolina and to apply for classification as a state resident for tuition purposes.\u00a0Guidelines and application forms for establishing residency are available from the UNC-Chapel Hill Graduate School.\nRegardless of the availability of stipend support, teaching responsibilities are required as a part of the program.\nThe Department of Pediatric Dentistry is committed to providing dental care to children living in underserved areas. We also believe that understanding working with these populations is an important part of educational training. Therefore, residents are required to rotate through a variety of extramural sites.\nResidents provide dental care for children at the Durham County Health Department under the mentorship of the Department of Pediatric Dentistry faculty. This rotation offers residents the opportunity to work as part of a community dental team. Most patients in this program are healthy children between 5 and 15 years of age.\nGraduate students provide care and assist DDS students in the provision of care for young Native American Cherokee children who often have extensive restorative and surgical dental needs. The week-long clinic is located in the modern Cherokee IHS Hospital in remote western North Carolina on the Cherokee Indian Reservation.\nThis is a clinical rotation wherein students provide care for patients with cerebral palsy and other developmental disabilities, most of which are related to traumatic head injuries.\nThis dual training program is designed to prepare pediatric dental residents for positions that require a breadth of knowledge of the field of public health.\u00a0All requirements of the degree must be completed within five years from time the student first matriculates in the MPH program.\nApplicants first must be accepted as a candidate for the dual program by the Department of Pediatric Dentistry and also must be granted admission to the SPH. Following the results of the MATCH, applicants that have been approved will be asked to apply for SPH admissions.\nIn addition to the courses in specialty of pediatric dentistry, residents in this program will take 13 courses at the\u00a0Gillings School of Global Public Health (SPH) and participate in a practicum or field training experience.\u00a0Each graduate student is expected to complete a research project.\nSince this program is a true combined program and SPH courses are integrated into the pediatric dentistry schedule, there are no additional tuition costs. There are additional practicum and professional fees.\nClick here for the course catalog. If the page does not automatically direct you, click \u201cPEDO\u201d at the top.\nStudents who are not graduates of an ADA-accredited dental school must complete a simulation exam as part of their NC intern permit process. Such candidates must pass and complete the simulation exam within two months of their formal matriculation in the program.

Through the affiliation with NYU Langone Dental Medicine\u2019s\u00a0Advanced Education in Pediatric Dentistry Program, residents at our DSE training site can expect to become well-trained pediatric dentists who are sensitive to community and family oral health care needs of pediatric and special needs populations in the State of Tennessee. There will be ample opportunity to treat a wide-range of oral health issues as our population of patients have an above average incidence of oral diseases.\nDSE\u2019s clinical training site,\u00a0Children\u2019s Dental Health Center (CDHC), has 11 operatories dedicated to pediatric dentistry. It is the primary location for clinical training. Many specialty clinics and affiliations support the residency program. Residents participate in after-hours on-call, in-patient pediatric medicine, pediatric sub-specialties and cleft palate team rotations. Several outpatient surgery centers will serve as rotations for the operating room.\nCDHC is located in a poor urban neighborhood, located just two miles outside the central business district of Nashville. CDHC is one of the only dental clinics in the greater Nashville market that provides transport services. During the past twelve months the clinic has managed over 32,000 patient interactions and is actively growing. The neighborhood where CDHC is located represents the most clinically at-risk populations in Greater Nashville. The population is principally African American and Hispanic children balanced equally between genders. The primary payment mechanism (94%+) is TennCare (state based Medicaid), followed by private insurance (3%) and private pay (3%).\nDSE has support staff and each resident will have one designated dental assistant for each clinic session. All staff involved in direct patient care are current with BLS/CPR certification and the residents and supervising pediatric dentists are ACLS/PALS certified. Digital intraoral and extraoral radiographic equipment is available within the dental center. Sedations and OR cases will be performed at the Specialty Surgery Center and the Oral Surgery anesthesiologists.

At the present time, usually two residents are accepted each year. Preference is given to those who have adequate preparation and aptitude.\nApplication instructions can be found\u00a0on the Instructions for Applicants\u00a0page.\u00a0\nApplicants for the program are considered on the basis of the following factors:\nIndividuals selected from the applicant pool for consideration for admission may be invited for a personal interview which is an additional basis for student selection.\nNon-U.S./Non-Canadian Degree Students At the present time foreign trained dentists (non-U.S. or non-Canadian dental degrees) are not being accepted for the postgraduate periodontal training program. This is because of licensing restrictions.\nEach resident's program provides a mixture of didactic instruction and clinical activity. The exact portion of time spent in each area varies somewhat with the resident's past experience and future goals.\nResidents are required to take core courses that will allow them to develop knowledge and expertise in the relationship of immunology, microbiology, pharmacology and cell biology to that of periodontal and implant diagnoses and treatments. Each resident develops clinical skills in diagnosis, treatment planning and therapy for patients with periodontal diseases and implant needs. All residents also develop competence in other clinical areas such as conscious sedation via oral, inhalation and intravenous routes.\nThere is also an opportunity to teach and lecture. Residents with an acute interest in education may choose electives through educational departments at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to expand knowledge and skills in areas such as teaching techniques, audiovisual production and testing/evaluation. The option to apply this information and actively participate in the design and presentation of didactic and clinical courses is available to the resident who plans a career in education.\nIn addition to the program of study required by the College of Dentistry's postgraduate education committee which oversees all the graduate specialty programs, the following are expected to be satisfactorily completed during the training program and prior to granting the certificate of specialization in periodontics:\nScholarly Activity During their tenure at the University of Nebraska, residents are expected to engage in some type of scholarly activity presented or published outside of the College of Dentistry. Common examples would be submission of a paper to a refereed journal, or presentation of an abstract at a regional or national meeting. The subject matter of this scholarly activity may be results of their research, a case report, a literature review, etc. This program requirement will be verified, prior to graduation, by the department chair.\nEmergencies and Pain Control The College of Dentistry has determined that a course in emergencies and pain control and participation on the CODE BLUE team and the after-hours emergency care program are parts of the academic program for all residents located in programs housed in the College of Dentistry in Lincoln.\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Each resident is required to be certified and maintain certification in basic CPR. A copy of the valid certification in basic CPR must be maintained at the College of Dentistry.\nAdvanced Cardiopulmonary Life Support (ACLS) Each resident will be certified during the program duration in ACLS.\nTeaching Participation in undergraduate teaching is a required activity, usually\u00a0two days per week, experienced in the third year of study.\nIn-Service Examination Each resident enrolled in the program will participate in the AAP's in-service examination given each year in the spring. Results of this examination remain confidential to the student.\nDepartmental Examination Each resident will successfully complete an oral examination given by the department at the end of each year. This is to prepare the resident to take the American Board of Periodontology examination.\nJoint Departmental Seminars Each resident will participate in joint departmental seminars with residents from other departments on a schedule determined by the departments.\nOrganizations Each resident must be a student member of the American Academy of Periodontology. Residents may also join and participate in if they so choose the Academy of Osseointegration, the American Dental Association, the Nebraska Society of Periodontology, and the Southwest Society of Periodontists.\nInstruments and Photographic Supplies Most instruments necessary for the evaluation and treatment of patients with periodontal diseases and implantology will be provided by the University to use while in the educational program. Each resident will furnish a digital camera suitable for quality intraoral photography to record and document clinical procedures and therapy. Digital cameras are a requirement and must be purchased by the resident prior to or within the first couple months after starting the program.\nBooks and Journals Occasionally, textbooks, which the resident will have to purchase, are required and utilized for didactic courses. The resident may also desire to purchase other selected texts for personal reference. A subscription to the \"Journal of Periodontology\" is required for all graduate residents. Required student membership in the Academy of Periodontology, which provides a subscription to the Journal of Periodontology, may be secured after matriculation into the program.\nVA Rotation Each resident spends a small portion of their clinical time at the Lincoln Veterans Administration Hospital treating patients with periodontal problems and implant needs. The exact amount of time spent at the VA Clinic is dependent upon the resident's individual program.\n2022-2023 Program Costs\nFor postgraduate students with a U.S. or Canadian dental degree, and Nebraska residents.\nClinical Fees\n$2,806 Fall Term (July 1-December 31)$2,806 Spring Term (January 1-June 30)$5,612 Per Year (total clinical fees)\nEquipment Assessment\n$2,050 Per Year\nTotal\n$7,662\nOne-time $37.45 fee for background check.

GME-eligible postgraduate students are eligible for a flexible benefit package which includes choices among health, life, and disability insurance.\nFuture income is contingent upon continued availability of federal funds and, therefore, is subject to change at any time. Due to the changes in GME funding, future funding may be at a reduced level.\nStudent Loans and Loan Deferment Currently, postgraduate students are considered students of the College of Dentistry for financial aid purposes. Postgraduate students may get financial aid information from the UNMC Financial Aid Office and student loan payments for postgraduate students can usually be deferred. Postgraduate students in periodontology may be eligible for loans through the American Academy of Periodontology.\nVacation/Sick Leave Postgraduate students receiving GME funding shall have ten (10) scheduled working days of paid leave per year. Leave includes vacation and sick leave. Leave in excess of ten (10) days per year must be taken as Leave Without Pay from the College or as Family Leave. Leave requests must be submitted as per the policies of the program and the College. Residents have additional vacation days that do not count toward the 10-day limit when the University is closed (e.g., the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, one week spring break, one week between spring and summer session and other holidays).\nPrivate Practice Private practice of dentistry is not permitted during the first year of residency. If the resident is progressing satisfactorily, the resident can practice in the private sector on weekends with administrative approval. The practicing resident must have a regular Nebraska dental license and is independent from the College of Dentistry during that period.\u00a0(See Nebraska Licensure)ImmunizationsThe University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry policy requires that all entering residents in programs requiring patient contact must be vaccinated or exhibit active immunity to tetanus, measles*, mumps, diphtheria, chicken pox, polio, rubella and Hepatitis B and have had a TB skin test within the last 6 months, unless the student has a previous positive test/medical contraindication. Each entering resident must verify at the time of matriculation that he or she has completed the accepted routine of vaccinations. An immunization record is required in order for the student to be registered.\n*Anyone born after 1957 is required to have two measles shots to assure immunity, with the second one given after 1980.\nAll postgraduate residents are expected to have a Nebraska Dental License (either temporary or regular) and federal DEA license before October 15 of the year of the commencement of their program so that they can participate in the after-hours emergency care program and to teach. The postgraduate student must document efforts to obtain licensure to the postgraduate admissions office by July 15. Failure to obtain a Nebraska Dental License and federal DEA license by October 15 may result in a reduction of duties, reduction or elimination of stipend, an extension of time necessary to complete program requirements, or dismissal from the program.\nIt is possible for a student who has graduated from an A.D.A. accredited American or Canadian dental school and licensed in another state, territory, or District of Columbia to obtain a temporary Nebraska Dental License during the time he or she is enrolled as a full-time postgraduate student. The temporary license is only for practice related and clinical teaching activities within the College of Dentistry and does not allow extramural private practice. After acceptance into the postgraduate program, licensure information may be obtained from the State of Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Attn: Dental Licensure, P.O. Box 94986, Lincoln, NE 68509-4986. Telephone: (402) 471-2115.\nFor a regular license, the Nebraska Board of Dentistry has determined that the following examinations will be accepted for Dentistry license applications completed between September 1, 2021, through August 31, 2022 (A passing score for each examination is determined by the respective testing agency):\nThe State Board also has provisions for licensure by credentials and interview for individuals licensed in other states.\nAs employees of the University, GME-eligible postgraduate students are considered residents of the State of Nebraska. Postgraduate students who are not GME eligible and are not from the State of Nebraska are not residents in the eyes of the University.\nThe University of Nebraska has in force professional liability insurance covering all students within the College of Dentistry.\nCurrent coverage is $1,000,000 per person per occurrence, with $100,000 deductible. The University provides self-insurance for the $100,000 deductible through the University's general and professional liability insurance program.\nMaster's Program In conjunction and simultaneously with a resident's education leading to a certificate of specialization in periodontology, a program is available to complete the requirements for M.S. degree. This program leading to a master of science degree awarded by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Graduate College is administered through the Department of Oral Biology in the College of Dentistry (Medical Sciences Interdepartmental Area [MSIA] Graduate Program).\nThe M.S. program consists of the conduct of an approved research project, the submission of a formal thesis and defense, and may involve expanded course-work depending on the resident's area of study. Extra time may be needed to meet the requirements of the M.S. degree. GME eligible residents, because they are University employees, receive tuition remission for up to 15 graduate credits per year.\nPh.D. Program A program may be designed for a certificate of specialization in periodontics and a Ph.D. through the medical sciences interdepartmental area in one of the participating departments such as oral biology. This program is structured for an individual planning on a full-time career in academics and research. Further information can be obtained from the program director.\nAfter acceptance by the student into the postgraduate certificate program, an application to the Graduate College for the M.S. program must be completed by the student who wishes to take the graduate degree program concurrently. Students interested in an M.S. degree should make application as soon as possible after acceptance to the periodontal program.\nApplicants seeking a graduate degree (M.S.) must also meet the admission requirements of the Graduate College and the MSIA Program.\nIn accordance with University policy, UNMC prohibits the denial of admission or of medical center privileges to residents or applicants on the basis of race, color, gender, national origin, age, disability or religious or political beliefs. These privileges include but are not limited to admission, class assignments, scholarships, fellowships, assistantships, and financial aid, as well as housing and recreational facilities. Furthermore, student organizations must base their selection of students for membership in criteria which will not include race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age or disability.\nAdmittance to UNMC programs will not be denied to otherwise qualified disabled individuals solely by reason of their disability. Qualified disabled persons are those who meet the academic and technical standards for each program.

{"objectID": "fe37474a14e1af0825923a82d43c4139", "title": "Division of Periodontics | College of Dental Medicine", "body": "Welcome to the Division of Periodontics at Columbia University, one of the oldest dental specialty divisions in the world. The division educates dental students in the specialty of Periodontics\u2014a discipline focusing on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal disease and in the placement of dental implants\u2014in a setting that emphasizes sound biological principles and evidence-based approaches. Our faculty guide our trainees in providing contemporary, comprehensive, and compassionate periodontal care to members of our surrounding community and those from the tri-state area who seek excellent specialty care at a renowned academic institution. The division also is home to three research labs whose investigations are advancing the professional knowledge base and developing innovative therapies in multiple clinical disciplines.\nThe predoctoral curriculum is designed to give students an understanding of the fundamental principles of Periodontics, knowledge of the range of procedures performed by periodontists, an appreciation of the importance of periodontal therapy in the context of comprehensive dental treatment, and the training necessary to provide patients with basic periodontal care.\nThe fundamental principles of periodontics are taught in an integrated fashion along with the other dental disciplines in the first- and second-year preclinical courses. These courses focus on a problem-oriented evaluation of the patient. At Columbia\u2019s comprehensive-care predoctoral clinic, third- and fourth-year students provide periodontal diagnoses and basic periodontal therapy to all of their patients. Additionally, third-year students participate in a rotation at the postdoctoral Periodontics program, where they attend didactic seminars and clinic sessions and participate in advanced periodontal and implant-related surgical procedures. All fourth-year dental students perform at least one periodontal surgery before graduation. Finally, fourth-year students who complete their clinical requirements early and have a particular interest in Periodontics may participate in an honors program where additional time is spent with the postdoctoral Periodontics curriculum.\nThe Postdoctoral\u00a0Periodontics Program\u00a0prepares the licensed dentist to practice the specialty of periodontics, either in private practice or in academia. Two parallel tracks are available: a primarily clinical track that leads to a Certificate in Periodontics\u00a0and a track that includes a substantial research component that leads to a Master of Science degree in Periodontics. Both tracks meet the educational requirements of the American Academy of Periodontology and the American Dental Association.\nThe Division offers one-week\u00a0externships\u00a0for third- and fourth-year dental students\u00a0as well as a\u00a0postdoctoral externship for foreign trained dentists.\u00a0\nMany of our faculty are practicing dentists with ColumbiaDoctors Dentistry, the faculty practice of the College of Dental Medicine. At these\u00a0sites, divisional faculty provide specialty treatment for the entire spectrum of periodontal diseases (gingivitis and periodontitis of various stages), including regenerative therapies (bone grafts), treatment for mucogingival defects (soft tissue grafts), pre-prosthetic procedures (crown lengthening, ridge augmentation/site development), and placement of dental implants for the rehabilitation of partial or full edentulism.\nThe Division of Periodontics also provides treatment for children and adults at the College of Dental Medicine's Teaching Clinics. Graduate dentists in specialty training provide care with the assistance and supervision of faculty specialists.\nThe division has several active research programs supported by multiple external sources including the National Institutes of Health, foundations, and industry. Current projects encompass the epidemiology and pathobiology of periodontitis, the microbially driven pathogenesis of oral and non-oral diseases, the identification of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes in the dental setting, and the evaluation of adjunctive approaches to enhance the outcomes of periodontal and peri-implant therapy.\nColumbia University has three research labs led by Periodontics faculty:\nResearch in the Han\u00a0laboratory focuses on the interactions of the vast population of microbes that inhabit various surfaces of the body and their human hosts. Visit the Han lab\u2019s web page.\nThe Momen-Heravi lab conducts immunology research with applications in periodontics, cancer, and diabetes. Specific projects include investigating how interactions between tumors and immune cells govern the progression of cancer, understanding the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and editing innate immune cells to combat cancer. Visit the Momen-Heravi lab\u2019s website.\nCurrent research of the Papapanou team centers on two main themes. One is understanding periodontitis pathobiology and the factors that affect susceptibility to periodontitis. The second focus is examining the role of periodontal infection/inflammation as a systemic health stressor. Visit the Papapanou lab\u2019s web page.\nThe Division of Periodontics publishes an annual newsletter to recognize the achievements of faculty and postdoctoral students and to highlight notable events and programming from the past year.

Prosthodontics is the dental specialty pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment planning, rehabilitation and maintenance of the oral function, comfort, appearance and health of patients with clinical conditions associated with missing or deficient teeth and/or oral and maxillofacial tissues using biocompatible substitutes.\nA fixed prosthesis is something that does not leave the mouth once inserted or placed. Examples include crowns and bridges. Removable prostheses can typically be taken in and out of the mouth. Examples of these include partial dentures and complete dentures. Dental implants can be used to support crowns on the back teeth (premolars and molars) and to support a lower complete denture. These implant services are available in the D.M.D. student dental clinic.\nThere are four clinics at the University of Florida College of Dentistry that provide prosthodontics services.

Serving as the architect of a dental treatment plan, a prosthodontist collaborates with general dentists, specialists and other health professionals to develop solutions to dental and oral health concerns.\nAt your screening appointment we will describe our residency program, complete an exam to determine if your needs fit the educational goals of our program.\nIf you wish to proceed with treatment, you will be assigned a resident for a diagnostic appointment which includes radiographs, impressions for diagnostic casts, intra oral pictures, and bite records. The resident will go over the final treatment plan and estimated cost. The resident that completes the screening is not always the resident that completes treatment.\nReferral Form\nFees vary by procedure and the needs of the patient.\nPatients are required to pay 50% of their treatment plan at the start of treatment and the balance upon completion.\nAccepted methods of payment: Cash, check (established patients only), Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover (including Flexible Spending credit cards).\nPatients with Delta Dental including Ohio State faculty, staff and students, are only required to pay estimated co-payments and deductibles. We accept many Medicaid Sponsored Insurance Plans. Please contact Patient Financial Services at the number listed below for information regarding your specific questions.

The residents also obtain experience in surgical implant placement, maxillofacial prosthetics, temporomandibular dysfunction, as well as\u00a0digital dentistry in all facets of dentistry.\u00a0The residency program will work closely together with the other post-doctoral dental specialty education programs at the School of Dental Medicine and the General Practice Residency program. The residents will learn an interdisciplinary approach to providing dental care, so upon completion of the program, they will have the necessary background and training to work well with other dental professionals. The program director will strive to ensure that all program faculty members are current with prevailing prosthodontic theories and techniques.\nThe program integrates all facets of the biomedical sciences with a comprehensive clinical experience culminating in the award of the certificate in prosthodontics.\n\u00a0\nGoals of the Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics\nTo provide progressive clinical, laboratory and didactic training, closely supervised, at\nthe post-doctoral level in fixed, removable, maxillofacial prosthetics and implant prosthodontics. The interrelation of other medical/dental clinical specialties is also emphasized.\nThe Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics has the following objectives:\nThe 36-month Graduate Medical Education (GME) funded post-doctoral level program in fixed, removable and implant prosthodontics provides the candidate with clinical proficiency and comprehensive knowledge of the diagnosis, treatment planning, rehabilitation and maintenance of oral function, comfort, appearance and health of patients with missing/damaged teeth and orofacial defects by using biocompatible artificial substitutes. The curriculum includes didactic and clinical instruction in complete dentures, removable partial dentures, fixed prosthodontics, implant dentistry (including implant surgery), geriatrics, temporomandibular disorders and maxillofacial prosthetics. The didactic background and the clinical and laboratory skills of these areas of prosthodontics are stressed.\nEmphasis is placed on the periodontal integrity of the patient and the supportive therapy of all other disciplines in achieving total patient care. This integration is achieved through interdisciplinary seminars with the other specialties and through coordinated treatment planning.\nAdditionally, all residents are expected to perform a clinical or scientific research project culminating in presentation of their project at a national meeting and/or publication of the project. It is important for a well-rounded prosthodontic resident to experience all aspects of the specialty including research and teaching as well as the aforementioned clinical and laboratory skills.\nThe intensive and systematized library reading assignments and literature review seminars are an important aspect of the curriculum. They are designed to acquaint the resident with the principal facets of the prosthodontic specialty, evidence-based health care and methods of critically reviewing the dental literature.\nAll residents are encouraged to plan on pursuing certification by the American Board of Prosthodontics. To this end, the residents will be required to take Section A of the board exam and present at least two patient treatments that would satisfy the requirements of two parts of Section B of the board exam. Residents are encouraged to challenge one part of Section B of the American Board of Prosthodontics certification exam in February of their third year.\nThis program follows the guidelines established by the ADA for Advanced Educational Programs in Prosthodontics and the multidisciplinary scope of the specialty certificate examination of the American Board of Prosthodontics.\nYear I Curriculum\nAdvanced Prosthodontic Laboratory Techniques\nBiomedical Sciences: Core Courses for Advanced Education Programs\nClinical Prosthodontics\nComplete Denture Prosthodontics\nDental Materials Science\nDigital Dentistry Literature Review\nEthics &amp; Professionalism in Dental Practice\nFixed Partial Denture Prosthodontics\nGeriatrics\nImplant Dentistry \u2013 Current Topics\nImplant Dentistry \u2013 Introduction\nIntroduction to Digital Dentistry\nMedical Emergencies\nOral Pathology and Oral Medicine\nPeriodontal / Prosthodontic Treatment Planning Seminars\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Fixed Partial Prosthodontics Technique\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Removable Prosthodontics Technique\nProsthodontic Laboratory Techniques\nProsthodontic Treatment Planning Seminar\nResearch Design and Biostatistics\nYear II Curriculum\nAdvanced Implant Prosthodontics\nAdvanced Occlusal Concepts\nClinical Prosthodontics\nDigital Dentistry Literature Review\nMaxillofacial Prosthetics (didactic)\nMedical Emergencies\nOcclusion and Dental Morphology\nPeriodontal / Prosthodontic Treatment Planning Seminars\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Fixed Partial Prosthodontics Technique\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Removable Prosthodontics Technique\nProsthodontic Board Preparation\nProsthodontic Literature Review\nProsthodontic Treatment Planning Seminar\nRemovable Partial Prosthodontics\nSedation\nYear III Curriculum\nCleft Palate Conference\nClinical Prosthodontics\nCraniofacial Growth and Development\nDental Facial Deformities (DFD) Conference\nDigital Dentistry Literature Review\nHead and Neck Tumor Board Meeting\nMaxillofacial Prosthetics (clinical rotation)\nMedical Emergencies\nPeriodontal / Prosthodontic Treatment Planning Seminars\nPractice Management\nProsthodontic Board Preparation\nProsthodontic Literature Review\nProsthodontic Treatment Planning Seminar\nNon-Course Requirements\nResearch Project\nEach resident shall develop a research protocol and perform a research project related to prosthodontics.

The clinical activities are located on the fourth floor of the school with additional laboratory space on the third floor.\n\n\n\n    Thank you for visiting our web site, and for your interest in prosthodontics! This is one of the fastest growing specialties in dentistry, and one of the most rewarding.\n\n\n    The goal of this program is to train prosthodontists who will be able to effectively rehabilitate patients who present with severely compromised oral conditions. Clinical treatment of patients is exemplified by excellence in three areas: planning, precision, and performance. Residents should exemplify these qualities by the end of the residency program. The primary goals of the didactic program are to provide  a literature base of the best available evidence from which to make sound clinical decisions, to train residents in the use and evaluation of literature to solve clinical problems, and to present a foundation of sound prosthodontic principles on which the resident can build in future years. The primary goals of the clinical program are to supply a breadth of experiences for residents to develop the clinical skills necessary for effective patient treatment in all aspects of prosthodontics.\n\n\n    While laboratory procedures are a necessary part of any prosthodontic program, the program utilizes lab support within the school as well as commercial dental labs to meet the needs of our patients. The latest digital workflows are constantly being utilized and improved and the residents are active in planning and designing restorations and implant position as well as radiographic and surgical guides. All of our residents design, assist, and place implants, and many with an interest in this area develop considerable surgical experience.\n\n\n    Our program is clinically oriented, and we are fortunate to have an extensive patient base and demand for prosthodontic services. Because of this, we are able to offer multiple clinical experiences in oral rehabilitation, esthetic dentistry, implant reconstructions, surgical implant placement, and removable and fixed prosthodontics.

Seminars and clinical instruction are related to theory and practice of the various concepts and instrumentation of gnathology, to the understanding and utilization of materials science, and utilization of the library and laboratory resources for expansion of knowledge and skills in prosthodontics.\n\n\n    The primary clinical activity is within the graduate prosthodontic clinic. The student is assigned patients selected by the appropriate department faculty to give increasingly more challenging treatment concepts. Also, specific treatment problems are assigned to demonstrate a particular concept. During the course of residency training, the resident may be assigned for rotation through the Maxillofacial Prosthetics Clinic and may be assigned for specific teaching responsibilities with the undergraduate programs in the School of Dentistry. Residents in the graduate prosthodontic program have the opportunity to surgically place implants. \n\n\n    There is a close liaison between the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry. All residents participate in interdisciplinary consultation and/or patient management. Particularly close relations exist among the various advanced education programs.\n\n\n    The University of Alabama School of Dentistry offers an extensive range of Continuing Education courses. Prosthodontic residents are required to attend those primarily related to fixed, removable and implant prosthodontics and are encouraged to attend others which may be of interest or value. Tuition costs for continuing education courses may be provided by the Department of Restorative Sciences.\n\n\n    The clinical activities are based on treatment of patients admitted to the School of Dentistry or affiliated hospitals and clinics of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Residents in the advanced education programs are expected to perform ethical, supervised and approved treatment for only those patients assigned to them by the appropriate faculty.\n\n\n    These measures are intended to protect the student from interference with a projected, planned program of graduate or postgraduate study.\n\n\n    The contents of this prospectus represent the most current information available at the time of publication.
