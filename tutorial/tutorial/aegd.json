Dentists who hold a BDS, DMD or DDS from an international dental school not accredited by CODA may apply to the AEGD program for international dentists. \u00a0\nThe field of dentistry is rapidly evolving, with new restorative technologies being pioneered and patients who live longer and have more complex medication and healthcare needs. The program takes you beyond the four-year DMD curriculum and strengthens your knowledge base and clinical judgment, helping you keep pace with advances in the field. While primary patient care provides the majority of residents\u2019 learning experience, you\u2019ll also further enhance your diagnostic skills and ability to develop patient-appropriate treatment plans through the didactic curriculum and weekly seminars covering treatment planning, literature reviews\u00a0and topics in general dentistry.\nResidents train to operate effectively and collaborate efficiently within cross-functional healthcare teams while honing their ability to provide emergency, multidisciplinary and patient-centered oral healthcare to a diverse community of patients with a broad spectrum of conditions and needs.\nCertificate students acquire robust clinical experience by working in the AEGD Clinic, which operates as a stand-alone clinic with a staff of dental assistants and hygienists. Rotations in postgraduate endodontology and periodontology and implantology supplement the comprehensive patient care assignment in the AEGD clinical facility. Dedicated faculty, who are experts in their fields and who are full-time, tenured members of the Department of Restorative Dentistry, instruct and support residents throughout their clinical development and treatment of complex cases.\nThe Kornberg School of Dentistry offers a postgraduate opportunity for dentists who hold a BDS, DMD or DDS degree from an international dental school not accredited by CODA. This comprehensive program includes both clinical and didactic training, and the flexibility to attain an optional Oral Health Sciences MS.\u00a0\nResidents in this one-year program also have the flexibility to pursue an optional second year of AEGD training and/or to earn an optional Master\u2019s of Science degree in Oral Health Sciences.\u00a0Those interested in the optional MS degree must apply to both the first-year AEGD and MS programs concurrently. If accepted to both programs, the tuition for the MS degree program will be included in the AEGD tuition.

The tuition cost for this program is a flat fee of $69,398 plus a $4,500 instrument fee.

{"title": "Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) | School of Dental Medicine | Case Western Reserve University", "body": "The AEGD Program is a 12-month certificate program providing extensive training in General Dentistry and emphasizes treatment planning, patient management and comprehensive care. The program provides didactic and clinical training in restorative dentistry, esthetic dentistry, endodontics, periodontics, full mouth rehabilitation, and implant dentistry (both surgical and restorative) to mention a few.\nThe experience is enhanced with relevant hospital exposure through the affiliation with University Hospitals of Cleveland. Along with its didactic curriculum, the program offers a variety of Continuing Education opportunities on a variety of subjects, and encourages individual achievements and life-long learning. It is staffed with dedicated full-time and volunteer faculty as well as an outstanding staff.\nThe AEGD Clinic offers state-of-the-art dental services in all areas of general and specialized dentistry. We offer placement and restoration of dental implants, full mouth reconstruction, restorative dentistry, cosmetic dentistry, root canal therapy, periodontal therapy, orthodontic therapy, and extractions. In our focus on comprehensive care for our patients, we use current technologies like CEREC, laser therapy, NobelClinician software, digital x-rays, and the teeth in a day process. For more information about the AEGD Clinic or how to become a patient, call 216.368.3290.\nAEGD residents were awarded first and third place in the table clinic competition at the Ohio Dental Association (ODA) annual session held in Columbus OH. Mohamad Othman, Abdulaziz Al-zahrani, and Steve Wang won first place for \u201cRationale for Socket Preservation in Implant Dentistry,\u201d their project showing that socket preservation procedures at the time of tooth extraction improve the prognosis regarding maintenance of the width and height of remaining bone. Also socket preservation can lead to more successful implant-supported restorations, with reduced treatment time overall. Joe Merci and William Chin were awarded third place for their presentation, \u201cStretching Bone to Allow Dental Implant Placement Increase Alveolar Bone Height Using Distraction Osteogenesis (DO),\u201d where Drs. Merci and Chin reviewed the current literature on Distraction Osteogenesis (DO) with different types of DO devices available today and compared them to conventional methods used in gaining bone. DO showed more bone gain on average and a higher success rate when compared to other methods."},

Zablocki VA Medical Center and in the modern Milo C. Huempfner VA Community Outpatient Clinic, the Great Lakes AEGD received its most recent accreditation on August 1st, 2019 by the Commission on Dental Accreditation and was granted the accreditation status of \u201cApproval Without Reporting Requirements\u201d.\r\nThe Great Lakes AEGD Residency is a 52-week post-doctorate dental education program designed to facilitate the professional growth of the recent dental graduate. It is intended to mentor competency, proficiency, and confidence in various dental specialties, manage medically compromised dental patients, and help the resident function effectively in hospital-based group practice.\r\nThe patient base associated at both sites is second to none. Both facilities provide comprehensive medical, surgical, and dental care for our veterans.\u00a0 This vast patient population serves as a tremendous resource for dental patients requiring every dental specialty. \u00a0\u00a0As with all Veterans Affairs sponsored programs, patients incur no cost for comprehensive treatment.\u00a0 Thanks to our Veterans Service, our program can deliver comprehensive general practice training that places an emphasis on treatment planning, preventative medicine, and restorative-driven dental therapies.\u00a0 With that said, residents will gain exposure to:\r\n\r\nPeriodontal Surgeries (including esthetic/restorative crown lengthening and osseous surgery)\r\nAdvanced Endodontics\r\nAdvanced Fixed and Removable Prosthodontics (including fully guided implant placement and restoration with the aid of ExoCAD and ExoPlan digital workflow)\r\nAdvanced Oral Surgery (including full arch edentulation, alveoloplasty, flap design, and advanced suturing techniques)\r\nOral Pathology\r\nManagement of medically compromised patients\r\n\r\nOur teaching staff believes that its role is to help each resident achieve clinical competencies and then challenge the resident\u2019s clinical understanding and decision-making capabilities.\u00a0 All training is conducted under the direction and supervision of full-time and part time staff. Attending instructors are educationally qualified and are present during clinic and lecture sessions for consultation.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe Great Lakes Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) Residency enrolls residents at two VA locations.\u00a0 The Clement J. Zablocki VAMC in Milwaukee, WI enrolls three to four AEGD residents and the Milo C. Huempfner VA Health Care Center in Green Bay, WI enrolls two AEGD residents.\r\nEach Resident is afforded:\r\n\r\nTheir own operatory to perform multiple aspects of dentistry\r\nTheir own desk and computer in the Doctor\u2019s Office\r\n\r\n\u00a0Each Resident\u2019s Operatory has:\r\n\r\nA dedicated dental assistant to work alongside the Resident\r\nDigital radiography equipment\r\nArmamentarium provided for comprehensive treatment:\r\n\r\nRoot Canal Therapy\r\nFixed &amp; Removeable Prosthodontics\r\nDirect Restorations\r\nOral Surgery\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patients are complex, and the standards are high. It is expected that residents will work efficiently as the needs of our veteran population are extensive, yet the overriding emphasis is on quality, not quantity. The dedicated and energetic resident will find unlimited opportunities to excel, not only clinically, but also through direct resident feedback, we are able to be innovative with our program and improve resident experiences.\r\nInterested candidates are encouraged to visit each training site.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The applicant must be enrolled in, or a graduate of an American Dental Association accredited dental school and have passed parts I and II of the National Dental Board Examination. Applicants must be a United States citizen. A state license in not required for the PGY-1 program but it is strongly encouraged.\u00a0 A dental license is required for any PGY-2 applicants\r\nApplications may be filed through the Postdoctoral Applications Support Service (PASS) sponsored by the American Association of Dental Schools. This system relieves the applicant of completing multiple and repetitive applications to individual programs by allowing the applicant to file one standardized application with this centralized service. Applications should be received by PASS by October 1. Please note, this program simply facilitates the application process and has no impact upon the selection process. Information and PASS application forms and instructions can be obtained online at\u00a0http://www.adea.org/.\r\nPlease note: This program does NOT participate in the National Matching Service (MATCH) sponsored by the American Association of Hospital Dentists.\r\nCandidates are selected based upon academic records, letters of recommendation, and a personal interview.\r\nThe prospective resident is reminded that significant variation exists between accredited programs in terms of personnel, resources, and patient demographics. The prospective resident must assess programs on an individual basis to determine whether the program structure and personality will satisfy their objectives in seeking additional professional education. A personal visit and interview are essential to achieve this goal.\r\nFor more information on the Great Lakes Veterans Affairs Advanced Education in General Dentistry Residency Information, please contact:\r\nClement J.

Teague Veterans Center in Temple, Texas is a major component of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System. The dental service offers an Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency. The 12-month program offers extensive training in oral diagnostics, radiology, restorative dentistry, periodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics, general oral surgery and moderate intravenous conscious sedation. Residents also receive training and practical experience in the surgical placement and restoration of endosteal dental implants. The AEGD residency accepts anywhere from two to three residents annually. The residency program is accredited fully by the American Dental Association and the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA).\r\nProgram Overview\r\nThe Olin E. Teague Veterans Center is in Temple, a city in central Texas, with a population of almost 75,000. It is situated 65 miles north of Austin and 36 miles south of Waco, along Interstate 35, and is centered approximately within a triangle formed by Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas-Ft. Worth.\r\nThe Olin E. Teague Veterans Center is part of the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS) with facilities located in Austin, Waco and here in Temple. The Doris Miller VA Medical Center in Waco is primarily a psychiatric facility, and the VA Clinic in Austin is mainly an outpatient clinic. All training phases of the AEGD residency program take place within the Temple VA facility. The Olin E. Teague Veterans Center contains a 269-bed general medical and surgical center, a 408-bed domiciliary and a 272-bed nursing home care unit.\r\nThe small-town atmosphere that Temple provides allows residents to form close relationships with faculty and consultants, as well as with other dental and medical residents. Our medical center has many ancillary facilities including an excellent medical library, a medical media production service, and a research department.\r\nClinical Facilities\r\nOur dental clinic is equipped with fifteen operatories which are utilized by dental, dental hygiene and digital radiology departments. All dental units and equipment are of modern design. Two dental laboratory technicians work at the Temple VA facility, and three technicians service the Waco VA facility. A complete audiovisual and videotape library is present at the Temple VA facility.\r\nOur website may be found at:\u00a0http://www.centraltexas.va.gov/services/Dental.asp\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The AEGD residents participate actively in the patient care mission of our medical center. However, their schedules are carefully planned to provide educational experiences to meet the requirements listed for the specific program by the ADA Commission on Dental Accreditation. The residents receive training in restoration of implants, periodontal surgeries, endodontics, esthetic restorations, fixed and removable prosthodontics (including full mouth rehabilitation), oral surgery, and the treatment of\u00a0medically compromised patients. A number of rotations to medical services offer the residents opportunity to enhance their knowledge of the relationship between oral and systemic problems, and to broaden their clinical experience in the management of patients with medical and psychiatric conditions.\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The General Dental Residency also provides dental care for UAB Hospital inpatients and interacts with multiple hospital medical departments that are seeking dental consultation. The main clinical activity for the combined program occurs in the Hospital Dental Clinic in the UAB Hospital. This program also takes responsibility for most of the oral medicine components of the D.M.D. curriculum.\n\n\nProgram Director:Dr. Christine Blass (205) 934-4178\nLength of Program: 1 year\nMatch Participant: Yes\nPass Participant: Yes\nCertificate Awarded: Yes\nDegree Awarded: No\nStipend Available: Yes\nTuition/fees: None\nInternational Students Accepted: Canada Only\nApplication Deadline: September 1\nProgram Start Date: July 1 (mandatory orientation 1 week prior to start date)\nApplication Materials Required:\nApplication Fee: Pay the $25 postdoctoral application processing fee online.\n\n    Acceptance Deposit Fee: A $250 non-refundable deposit is due upon acceptance to the program.

This is a two-track program with a GPR track with four 4 residents and an AEGD track with 2 residents. Both programs share clinical facilities, have the same auxiliary staff, utilize the same attending faculty and share didactic lectures. All 6 GDR residents rotate in OMFS for 6 weeks divided into two three-week rotations; Emergency Medicine for 2 weeks; 2 weeks in Otolaryngology; 1 week in Radiation/Oncology and have a 1 week elective rotation in a medical or dental specialty. The 4 GPR track residents rotate in Anesthesia for 2 weeks and the AEGD track residents rotate in Pediatric Dentistry for 2 weeks. We believe this merger emphasizes the strengths of both programs \u2013 comprehensive general dentistry on patients with complex medical histories. A second year in either program is offered each year for one resident. At the successful completion of the GDR program each resident will receive either a GPR certificate or an AEGD certificate depending upon the track selected.\n\n\n    The General Dental Residency (GDR) Program is a postdoctoral educational program designed to provide essential skills, attitudes, and abilities related to the contemporary practice of advanced general dentistry, with emphasis on total patient care. The program provides the recent graduate the opportunity to augment his/her knowledge of oral disease and his/her diagnostic and therapeutic skills in dentistry. Treatment of oral disease in the medically complex patient and/or hospitalized patient is emphasized. A private practice environment is maintained throughout the program to assist the recent dental school graduate in the transition from academics to \u201creal world dentistry\u201d.\n\n\n    The formal goals and objectives are:\n\n\n    The GDR Program co-sponsored by the University of Alabama-Birmingham School of Dentistry and the UAB Hospital consists of 12 months of advanced dental education in clinical dentistry and is conducted primarily within a hospital environment.  An optional second GPR or AEGD year is available on a competitive basis. This latter position is generally limited to one position per year and is dependent upon qualifications.\n\n\n    Goal 1: Act as a Primary Health Care Provider at a level more advanced than a GPR/AEGD Level 1 resident.\n\n\n    Provide multidisciplinary comprehensive dental care to a wide variety of patients by pursuing training in advanced dental clinical fields of interest including but not limited to:\n\n\n    Goal 2: Obtain more advanced didactic training in both medicine and dentistry. \n\n\n    They will be offered graduate level courses in the following areas:\n\n\n    Goal 3: Complete medical/dental rotations not offered to Level 1 residents. \n\n\n    These may include:\n\n\n    Goal 4: The Level 2 resident will assume more administrative responsibility in the administration of a GPR/AEGD residency.\n\n\n    Goal 5: The Level 2 resident will gain experience in the academics of dentistry. \n\n\n    These experiences will include:\n\n\n    Note: In pursuing these objectives the Level 2 (PG2) resident will not repeat Level 1 (PG1) rotations and academic courses. It is anticipated the Level 2 resident will spend 15% more time delivering clinical dental care. Each Level 2 resident in conjunction with the program director will tailor this Level 2 year to his/her interests.\n\n\n    The program begins July 1st and concludes June 30th. In general, entering residents are required to report approximately the 20th of June for UAB Hospital orientation and help in patient transition (date to be provided after acceptance to the program).\n\n\n    Formal postgraduate courses taken with other post-graduate dental students include Physical Diagnosis, Conscious Sedation, and Dental Management of the Medically Complex Patient.  A portion of most Thursday mornings is set aside for resident seminars that range from formal lectures to treatment planning sessions. At these sessions other issues are discussed relating to the clinic practice (scheduling, emergencies, etc.). All GDR residents, including those on rotation, are required to attend these sessions. Space permitting, continuing education courses offered by the School of Dentistry are available for a minimal fee to postgraduate students.  Approximately 30 courses are offered each year at UAB.\n\n\n    Although not required, opportunities for research are available for the interested resident. Time is limited, but several motivated residents have successfully participated in a variety of research endeavors. The program director can provide additional information.\n\n\n    Goal 1: To prepare residents to provide comprehensive general dentistry services at a level beyond that achieved as a Level 1 GPR/AEGD resident.\n\n\n   Goal 2: To improve the resident\u2019s ability to treat a wide variety of patients with complex medical histories and special needs.\n\n\n    Goal 3: To apply scientific principles to learning and oral health care.\nTo use the principles of critical thinking, evidence of outcomes-based clinical decision making and evidence-based decision information retrieval systems.\n\n\n\n    Goal 4: To utilize the values of professional ethics, lifelong learning, patient centered care, adaptability, and acceptance of cultural diversity in professional practice by acting as mentor for Level 1 residents.\n\n\n    Goal 5: To understand and participate in the oral health needs of communities and engage in community service.\n\n\n    Goal 6: To provide more advance clinical care than Level 1 residents in the following areas:\n\n\n    University Hospital Dental ClinicThe University Hospital Dental Clinic is a 13-chair dental facility located in the UAB Hospital. Each operatory is appropriately equipped. Digital radiography is available throughout the clinic. There are three front-office staff, four dental assistants and one hygienist assigned to the GDR clinic full-time. Inpatient and outpatient needs are readily served by the clinic's convenient location. Convenient parking for patients is available.\n\n\n    University Hospital\nThe University of Alabama Hospital is a major teaching and service facility with a capacity of over 900 beds and educates 900+ medical/dental residents. This well-respected tertiary care hospital serves patients regionally, nationally, and internationally.

This collaboration helps to provide this medical center with excellent resources and an academic environment that provides for an outstanding residency program in general dentistry.\nThe AEGD Residency Program is a comprehensive General Dentistry Program with advanced training in most aspects of dentistry. The program is designed to provide training beyond the level of pre-doctoral education in oral health care, using applied basic and behavioral sciences. Education is based on the concept that oral health is an integral and interactive part of total health. Our program is designed to expand the depth and scope of the graduates knowledge and skills to enable them to provide comprehensive oral health care to a diverse range of population groups, with an emphasis on the medically compromised. Our philosophy of resident education, was best articulated by the well respected dental educator, the late Dr. Morton Amsterdam, who was quoted as saying: \u201cWe all have eyes with which to see, but\u00a0\u00a0we see only that, which we know.\u201d\nThe residents rotate through a series of clinical disciplines that include endodontics, operative, oral diagnosis, periodontics, prosthodontics, and oral surgery(3 months).One of the strengths of our program is the training received in the surgical placement of dental implants, advanced bone grafting techniques including site preservations and indirect sinus lifts, and periodontal surgical\u00a0\u00a0procedures. There is also an opportunity to become IV sedation certified with the didactic and clinical training provided through the oral surgery rotation.\u00a0\u00a0Each resident is required to complete two comprehensive care cases that have been completely documented with radiographs, mounted study models, and clinical photographs. These cases will be presented to the clinical faculty in June, prior to the completion of the program.\u00a0\nThe program provides the residents with the opportunity to interact with physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health care professionals as part of a multi-disciplinary health care team.\u00a0\u00a0The goal of providing each resident with the opportunity for professional growth and advancement, is enhanced by\u00a0\u00a0monthly participation in Literature\u00a0\u00a0Review , a monthly Clinical Seminar Series on current procedures and techniques, and the continuing educational opportunities offered at UAB School Of Dentistry.\u00a0\nLast updated: February 8, 2022"},

{"title": "The Advanced Education In General Dentistry-1 (AEGD-1) | VA Fayetteville Coastal Health Care | Veterans Affairs", "body": "Dental is located on the ground floor of the main hospital building with 13 dental treatment rooms and an on-site dental laboratory. The faculty consists of one service chief, one assistant chief, six full time dentists and two rotating part-time consultants. The remainder of the staff consists of three dental hygienists, 14 dental assistants, one lead assistant, four dental laboratory technicians, and one program assistant. The dental clinic uses current state of the art equipment: endo microscopes, digital radiography and cone beam computed tomography.\nProgram Description:\nThe Advanced Education in General Dentistry-1 (AEGD-1)\u00a0Program at the Fayetteville, North Carolina Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) is a one-year residency that accepts five residents per year. Our goal is to provide the general dentist with continued opportunity for professional growth and advancement. This comprehensive program prepares the resident to meet the oral health needs of a wide variety of medically compromised ambulatory and hospitalized patients. It also advances the residents\u2019 knowledge and skill in clinical dentistry by exposing them to a significant number of supervised, comprehensive treatment experiences. The program provides residents with the opportunity to interact with physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers and other health care professionals as part of a multi-disciplinary health care team.\nThe program curriculum is conducted at the postgraduate level (PGY-1) and consists of didactic and clinical instruction in nearly all areas of dental treatment modalities under the guidance of experienced professionals.\nEmphasis is made in the treatment planning and comprehensive treatment of medically compromised patients through direct faculty supervision and case presentations where all aspects of patient management are discussed.\nResidents have the opportunity to place and restore dental implants. The didactic phase of the program consists of literature reviews, conferences, lectures and demonstrations at the VA Medical Center as well as interaction with our Department of Defense partners at Fort Bragg. Operating room cases and rotations to other services are some of the activities that complement the clinical curriculum. Rotations in Primary Care, Anesthesiology and the Urgent Care are designed to facilitate the residents\u2019 experiences with medically compromised patients, hospital and surgical protocols, physical evaluation and medical assessment and increase their knowledge of systemic diseases and the medications used to treat our patients. As part of the program\u2019s community service, residents and staff provide oral surgery services at a local dental clinic that provides care to low income individuals.\nCODA Commission on Dental Accreditation\nThe program in Advanced Education in General Dentistry is accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation [and has been granted the accreditation status of Approval Without Reporting Requirements.] \u00a0The Commission is a specialized accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education. The Commission on Dental Accreditation can be contacted:\nThe Commission on Dental Accreditation\n211 East Chicago Avenue\nChicago, IL 60611\n312-440-4653\u00a0\nThe Commission\u2019s web address is:\u00a0Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) (ada.org) *.\u00a0\n*This link takes you outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs Website. VA does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of non-VA linked websites. The link will open in a new window.\nThe Commission on Dental Accreditation has accredited the postdoctoral program in Advanced Education in General Dentistry. However, this education area is not one of the American Dental Association\u2019s recognized dental specialty areas. Therefore, dentists graduating from this program cannot announce that they are specialists, as recognized by the American Dental Association.Opportunity to File Complaints\nThe Commission on Dental Accreditation will review complaints that relate to a program\u2019s compliance with the accreditation standards. The Commission is interested in the sustained quality and continued improvement of dental education programs but does not intervene on behalf of individuals or act as a court of appeal for treatment received by patients or individuals in matters of admission, appointment, promotion, or dismissal of faculty, staff or students.\nThe Commission will consider only written, signed complaints; oral and unsigned complaints will not be considered.

This translates to on-time attendance at all scheduled lectures and conferences while devoting time beyond regular clinic hours to program related activities. Residents are encouraged to participate actively in all case presentations and treatment planning discussions and critically analyze and discuss scientific articles during the literature review meetings.\nResidents are expected to diagnose and treat veteran patients in a diligent and compassionate manner and to relate well and respectfully to fellow workers and the general public. Appropriate dress and appearance is required for all activities associated with the program. Scrub-wear is provided.\nDental Residents are evaluated daily on their knowledge through interactions with mentors in the clinical setting, literature reviews, treatment planning conferences and during case discussions. Their treatment skills are also evaluated daily through clinical observations, review of lab cases, daily and monthly record reviews and other contact with mentors.\u00a0\u00a0 Resident\u2019s skills are assessed and critiqued whenever they are observed and residents are informed of ways to improve clinical skills, dental record entries and/or patient management techniques. Informal counseling is used to identify both strengths and weaknesses and includes advice on how to provide better dental care for their patients. Formally, residents are evaluated quarterly in writing by the mentors and director using the Dental Resident Rating Report.\nA. Operative Dentistry:\n1.

Over 50,000 veterans are provided comprehensive healthcare. While a full range of medical services are available, the Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center is nationally recognized for its comprehensive Mental Health, Blind Rehabilitation, and Spinal Cord Injury Centers.\r\nThe population treated within the VA hospital setting has significant dental needs. Concomitantly, patients typically have an array of debilitating physical, psychological, and medical conditions that complicate their dental treatment. The staff and residents are highly trained in the management of these complex patients.\u00a0 The spectrum of dental care ranges from limited exams of urgent dental needs to comprehensive evaluation and treatment of eligible inpatients and outpatients, which encompasses virtually all specialty areas in dentistry. Experience is provided in treating patients with dental conditions associated with or exacerbating significant medical problems, such as head and neck cancer, spinal cord injury, diabetes, cardiac valve dysfunction, joint replacement, and organ transplantation.\r\nThe Dental Service receives support from other services within the Medical Center, such as Radiology and Laboratory.\u00a0 Additionally, it provides broad consultative services to ENT, Neurology, Radiation Therapy, Orthopedics, Psychiatry, Medicine, Spinal Cord Injury, Community Living Center, and Pulmonary Sleep Clinic. An Urgent Clinic provides residents with experience in evaluating patients with emergent dental needs.\u00a0\r\nThe Dental Service is staffed by 12 full-time and part-time dentists (including specialists in endodontics, maxillofacial prosthodontics, periodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery),\u00a04 AEGD residents, 4 hygienists, 16 dental assistants, and 1 laboratory technician.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRESIDENCY PROGRAM\r\nThe Advanced Education in General Dentistry program is a 12-month program designed to provide clinical and didactic training in general dentistry at the post-doctoral level. Four resident positions are available. The program is accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. A certificate is awarded to the resident upon successful completion of the program. The stipend is approximately $60,700.\r\nThis program will prepare the resident to deliver total oral health care by providing instruction and experience involving ambulatory and hospitalized patients with a wide spectrum of medical conditions. It will also offer the opportunity to work with other health care professionals in the hospital and broaden clinical exposure to conditions not commonly seen in the clinic of a dental school. The educational experience is organized into block rotations- Restorative/Removable (6 months), Oral Surgery (3 months), and Endodontics/Periodontics (3 months).\r\nThe program is very clinically oriented and residents obtain significant experience in endodontics, surgical periodontics, surgical placement and restoration of implants, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and complex prosthodontic treatment \u2013 both fixed and removable. The educational curriculum is based on residents demonstrating competency in a variety of dental proceudures.\u00a0Each resident works with an assigned dental assistant. Support staff provide assistance in scheduling and other administrative functions.\r\nDidactic education is provided in pharmacology, hospital dentistry, endodontics, periodontics, implant dentistry, oral pathology, and practice management. Literature Review and treatment plannng sessions are held weekly.\r\nThe goals and objectives of residency training is as follows:\r\n\u00a01) Act as a primary oral health care provider- effectively evaluate, plan and provide emergency and multidisciplinary comprehensive oral health care\r\n2) Assess, diagnose, and plan for the provision of multidisciplinary oral health care for a wide variety of patients including patients with special needs\r\n3) Manage the delivery of patient-focused health care\r\n4) Comprehensively examine, diagnose, plan, and perform treatment for varied and complex restorative needs in operative dentistry\r\n5) Comprehensively examine, diagnose, plan, and perform treatment for the replacement of teeth including fixed, removable, and/or implant prosthodontics\r\n6) Periodontal therapy - enhance knowledge and experience in the etiology, diagnosis, planning and treatment of periodontal disease including surgical and non-surgical periodontal techniques\r\n7) Endodontic Therapy - enhance knowledge and experience in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute and chronic pathology of the pulp and periapical structures of single and multi-rooted teeth\r\n8) Oral Surgery - enhance knowledge and experience in basic oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures including exodontia, pre-prosthetic surgery, orofacial trauma and infection,\u00a0 biopsy of hard and soft tissue pathology, and post-operative complications\r\n9) Enhance knowledge and experience in the evaluation and treatment of dental emergencies\r\n10) Enhance knowledge and experience in pain and anxiety control using behavioral and pharmacological techniques\r\n11) Be able to recognize and manage common medical emergencies in the dental setting\r\n12) Enhance understanding of the evaluation, diagnosis, planning, and performance of treatment in implant restorations including single and multi-unit fixed restorations and implant-assisted removable prostheses, maintenance, and complications\r\n13) Improve evaluation, development of differential diagnoses, and obtaining diagnostic studies and/or biopsies for hard and soft tissue lesions of the oral cavity\r\n14) Improve understanding of the physiology, etiology, and conservative management of orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders\r\n15) Improve understanding in examination, diagnosis, and management of\u00a0occlusal disorders including correction of occlusal disorders with proper equilibration and/or restoration\r\nThe hospital is located near the Belmont Shore area of Long Beach.\u00a0 Belmont Shore is an oceanside promenade with numerous shops, restaurants, and cafes.\u00a0 Housing is abundant, with many apartments within walking distance of the medical center.\u00a0 Long Beach is in the Greater Los Angeles area, which provides easy access to unparalleled activities \u2013 sports, entertainment, and nightlife.\r\nThe current PGY-1 stipend (2022) is approximately $60,700.\r\nFor further information, see the following video:\u00a0https://youtu.be/PCnSK-rn4I4 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

However, accreditation of the program does not in itself constitute recognition of any dental specialty status.\u00a0\nThe purpose of the UNMC College of Dentistry's AEGD program is to train recent dental school graduates to deliver comprehensive dental care to a wide range of patients with varying needs, in different clinical environments at an advanced level of skill and/or complexity beyond that accomplished in their pre-doctoral education. The resident\u2019s basic knowledge and skills will be reinforced and expanded in the areas of pathology, diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical and preventive dentistry, dental emergencies and pain and anxiety control utilizing behavioral and/or pharmacological techniques. In addition, the resident will be exposed to advanced training in the areas of endodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, pediatric dentistry, implantology, TMD and restorative dentistry. Furthermore, the program strives to instill in the resident, practice management and production skills that will translate into their private practices upon completion of the residency program. Finally, it will reinforce the necessity of lifelong learning and strengthen critical thinking to apply evidenced based patient care.\nGoals and Objectives of the Program\nThe Commission on Dental Accreditation describes the goals of an AEGD as follows:\u00a0Advanced Education Programs in General Dentistry are educational programs designed to provide training beyond the level of pre-doctoral education in oral health care, using applied basic and behavioral sciences. Education in these programs is based on the concept that oral health is an integral and interactive part of total health. The programs are designed to expand the scope and depth of the graduates\u2019 knowledge and skills to enable them to provide comprehensive oral health care to a wide range of population groups. The goals of these programs should include preparation of the graduate to:\nUpon successful completion of the one-year AEGD residency program at UNMC, the resident will receive a certificate. The following criteria will be utilized in evaluating the resident for certification. As part of the current competency and proficiency movement in postgraduate general dentistry, it will be the resident\u2019s responsibility to provide documentation of their experiences during the residency. (Competency statements are available on-site for review or are available upon request.) Documents will be gathered and presented for review by the faculty on a periodic basis. Documents will be stored through the use of a portfolio. Criteria for successful evaluation will be:\nProgram Director - The program has a director responsible for the day-to-day administration of the clinic. The director also spends a significant percentage of time with the residents in both clinical and educational components of the program.\nAttending Staff - Residents receive guidance, supervision, education and treatment planning advice from both generalists and specialists throughout the program. Specialists are available for consultation on a regularly scheduled basis and include endodontics, oral pathology, oral surgery, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, and oral-maxillofacial prosthetics. Patients are scheduled by the residents for consultation or supervision of treatment with a specialist when the resident feels the patient has need for special consideration.\nSupport Staff - Residents are provided with dental assistant support to allow for utilization of four-handed dentistry. A billing / insurance specialist and clinic scheduler are available to ensure efficient administration of patient scheduling, records and finances. Dental hygienists are also employed to help provide preventive, diagnostic, periodontal and other adjunct services to our patients.\nAttending Staff and Adjunct Faculty\nUNMC College of Dentistry Dental ClinicThe UNMC College of Dentistry Dental Clinic is located in the University of Nebraska Medical Center Durham Outpatient Center. The clinic was renovated in 2019. The project included\u00a015 fully equipped operatories, a laboratory, sterilization area, radiographic imaging room with a digital pantomograph unit, resident's room, scheduling office, billing office, large waiting room and restrooms.\nThe dental operatories in the clinic are fully equipped. The clinic utilizes a digital radiographic system and computer workstations for chairside use. The dental units are state-of-the-art equipment with fiber optic capabilities. A surgical endodontic microscope and CEREC Omnicam and Blue-cam with a milling unit for porcelain restoration fabrication are also available for resident\u2019s use. Rotary Endodontic and Implant Placement Systems, including handpieces, are frequently utilized as well as a soft-tissue laser. Several new complete sets of oral surgery instruments are available. A portable radiographic unit (Nomad) and dental unit as well as two portable pulse oximeters are available for treatment rendered in the operating room or on the patient floors.\nLibrarySince the program is located at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, an extensive library facility is immediately available for the resident's use. The McGoogan Health Sciences Library within the University Hospital has all necessary medical and most major dental publications. The C.Y. Thompson Library in Lincoln can supply other dental references or minor publications required for resident use. Library loan or courier service can provide journals, articles or books quickly. In addition, extensive audiovisual files are in the Medical Center Library for the resident's review. Computer access to internet reference sites is available in the clinic's resident room.\nDental residents spend approximately 75% of their time providing dental care to a wide variety of patients. These groups include:\nResidents will participate in the screening of patients admitted to the program and the development of definitive treatment plans. The treatment plans are presented to the attending staff in the dental clinic and at weekly treatment planning meetings. At that time, the attending staff will review the treatment plan with the residents and make recommendations, review options of treatment and discuss rationale of treatment plan decisions. An active Nebraska state dental license is necessary to participate in this program and to receive the stipend. Incoming residents will be provided with additional information regarding temporary state licensure.\nSpecial emphasis is given to oncology, liver transplant, heart transplant, pancreas transplant, cardiac valve replacement, HIV patients and their problems. The dental residency program works closely with these services preparing and managing these patients.\nTraining in physical evaluation will be provided during the first months of the program to allow the residents to more actively participate in the care of patients.\nSafe Work EnvironmentThe program follows State, Federal, and National regulatory bodies with respect to asepsis and safety within the workplace. Emergency preparedness and safe work environment materials are available for review. Some of these documents will be provided to the resident during orientation.\nA number of educational programs have been developed for the dental residents. These educational programs are designed to provide the residents with additional exposure to both medical and dental problems and developments. The following programs are regularly scheduled for the resident's benefit:\nEducational seminars presented by the attending staff, guest lecturers or medical/dental specialists will focus on advanced techniques in the individual's specialty or interest areas. Educational seminars presented by the residents will focus on management of dental patients with special needs or complex management and on implant placement/restoration patient cases.\nOral pathology conferences are presented by an oral pathologist. The conferences review and augment the resident's knowledge of oral and general pathology as well as oral medicine.\nOral surgery conferences are presented by various medical or oral surgery attending staff or residents. The subjects covered include a variety of dental and medical problems, techniques important to diagnosis and management of patients and techniques or problems in oral surgery. Seminar subjects will cover basic and special considerations for inpatient and outpatient care of dental patients undergoing combined medical and dental procedures. Principles of fluid balance, laboratory interpretation, pain management, TMJ disorders, infection and medication management are just a few examples of subjects presented. A physical assessment course is also provided through the Oral Surgery Service.\nA six-week lecture course on a restorative approach to implants is also provided with the oral surgeons\u2014this addresses both surgical and restorative aspects of implant placement and restorative. Implant case conferences are held at the VA amongst the prosthodontist, generalists, oral surgeons and residents to discuss cases prior to implant placement and to achieve the best results surgically and restoratively.\nTreatment planning/case review seminars are monthly presentations of difficult or unusual dental patients. The residents are requested to present the patient's medical and dental problems, how they affect the patient and his/her treatment, and what treatment was prescribed and carried out.\nDistance Learning PolicyDidactics are available remotely utilizing Zoom teleconferencing. To assure academic integrity, and to maintain security and privacy, residents gain access to course materials and educational resources by means of secure login authentication. Upon admission to UNMC, each resident is assigned a unique electronic identity, which is protected by a password. All communications are managed through the secured learning management system, including contact with the instructor and collaboration with peers. The submission of assignments, and accessing grades are not planned to be communicated through remote learning. Attendance and verification are also easily accomplish via simple voice and video identification during live broadcast teleconferences. There is no charge to the residents for distance education.\nEmergency On CallResidents will provide emergency on call while at the College of Dentistry in Lincoln when on rotation there.\nOff-Service Rotations\nEach rotation is expected to enhance and enrich the resident\u2019s experiences. The clinic directors at each site will be invited to participate in orientation activities or participate as available in an orientation week held in July in order to review program goals and objectives and conduct calibrations. They will be responsible for supervising the residents and providing evaluations of the resident\u2019s performance.\nImmunizationsThe University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry policy requires that all entering students in programs requiring patient contact must be vaccinated or exhibit active immunity to tetanus, measles*, mumps, diphtheria, chicken pox, polio, rubella and Hepatitis B and have had a TB skin test within the last six months, unless the student has a previous positive test/medical contraindication. Each entering student must verify at the time of matriculation that he or she has completed the accepted routine of vaccinations. An immunization record is required in order for the student to be registered. *Anyone born after 1957 is required to have two measles shots to assure immunity, with the second one given after 1980.\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)Each student is required to be certified and maintain certification in basic CPR provided by the American Heart Association. A copy of the current and valid certification in basic CPR must be maintained at the College of Dentistry. Certification in Advanced Life Support (ACLS) also is encouraged.\nStipendThe estimated stipend will be approximately $40,000, and is not determined until June of the residency year. GME-eligible postgraduate students are eligible for a flexible benefit package which includes choices among health, life, and disability insurance. Future income is contingent upon continued availability of federal funds and, therefore, is subject to change at any time.\nThe dental resident will be responsible for the timely payment of established program fees and will receive a salary. Established program fees which are the responsibility of the resident include $1,025 per semester equipment tax fee ($2,050 total) and background check fee of $30.\nStudent Loans and Loan DefermentCurrently, postgraduate students are considered students of the College of Dentistry for financial aid purposes. Postgraduate students may get financial aid information from the UNMC Financial Aid Office and student loan payments for postgraduate students can be deferred.\nVacation/Sick LeavePostgraduate students shall have fifteen (15) scheduled working days of paid Leave per year. Leave includes vacation, sick leave, and professional development leave. Leave in excess of fifteen (15) days per year must be taken as Leave Without Pay from the College or as Family Leave. Such extended leave may result in extension of the training program without pay. Leave requests must be submitted as per the policies of the program and the College.\nPrivate PracticeStudents are allowed to participate in private practice (moonlighting activities) but must arrange their schedules with the program co-directors to prevent conflict with program responsibilities.\nState of Nebraska ResidencyAs employees of the University, GME-eligible postgraduate students are considered residents of the State of Nebraska.\nThe University of Nebraska has in force professional liability insurance covering all enrolled students of the College of Dentistry performing services as part of the College's program.\nCurrent coverage is $1,000,000.00 per person, per occurrence, with $100,000.00 deductible. The University provides self-insurance for the $100,000.00 deductible through the University's general and professional liability insurance program.\nAll postgraduate students are expected to get a Nebraska Dental License (temporary or regular) and federal and state DEA licenses before October 15 of the year of the commencement of their program. The postgraduate student must document efforts to obtain licensure to the Postgraduate Admissions Office by July 15. Failure to obtain Nebraska Dental License and federal and state DEA licenses by October 15 may result in a reduction of duties, reduction or elimination of stipend, an extension of time necessary to complete program requirements, or dismissal from the program. Failure to obtain licensure or maintain licensure during the course of the residency will result in dismissal from the program and no certification of participation.\nIt is possible for a student who has graduated from an A.D.A. accredited American or Canadian Dental School to obtain a temporary Nebraska Dental License during the time he or she is enrolled as a full-time postgraduate student. The temporary license is only for practice related activities within the College of Dentistry and does not allow extramural private practice. After acceptance into the postgraduate program licensure information may be obtained from the State of Nebraska Department of Health, Bureau of Examining Boards.\nFor a regular license, the State Board accepts the results of the clinical examination given by the C.O.R.E. in 1995 (CRDTS/NERB), or CRDTS. The State Board also has provisions for licensure by credentials for individuals licensed by other states.\nApplicant EligibilityStudents accepted for postgraduate training in the advanced education in general dentistry residency program must have a dental degree from a U.S.A. American Dental Association-accredited dental college or school. Selection FactorsAdditional criteria upon which applications are viewed include:\nApplicant ProcessThe Advanced Education in General Dentistry program participates in PASS, but not match. All applicants must follow the guidelines established by this service to be eligible for the program.\nIn accordance with University policy, UNMC prohibits the denial of admission or of Medical Center privileges to students or applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability or religious or political beliefs. These privileges include but are not limited to admission, class assignments, scholarships, fellowships, assistantships, and financial aid, as well as housing and recreational facilities. Furthermore, student organizations must base their selection of students for membership in criteria which will not include race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.\nAdmittance to UNMC programs will not be denied to otherwise qualified disabled individuals solely by reason of their disability. Qualified disabled persons are those who meet the academic and technical standards for each program. These nonacademic skills are essential to successful program completion.\nIn summary, UNMC policies are in accord with:\nThe objective of the University of Nebraska Medical Center is to recruit and retain persons of high moral and ethical character. In accordance with this objective, the University of Nebraska Medical Center reserves the right to review a candidate's suitability for admission.\nJay D Hansen, DDSProgram DirectorUNMC College of Dentistry Dental Clinic (Omaha)989375 Nebraska Medical CenterOmaha, NE 68198-9375402-559-4885jay.hansen@unmc.edu\nPostgraduate Dental Programs Julie Buss UNMC College of Dentistry 4000 East Campus Loop SouthLincoln, NE 68583-0740402-472-6261jbuss@unmc.edu"},

program with a second-year option designed to serve low-income patients with no insurance and limited access to dental care.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOur AEGD program focuses on broad-based dental experiences for residents, and compassionate care for our patients. We offer advanced training experiences in dental implants, implant site development, rotary endodontics, exodontia, and restorative work, as well as other aspects of general dentistry. We also provide IV sedation training, which is somewhat unique among AEGD programs.\u00a0Additionally, using our online curriculum and conferencing technology, Residents will be able to engage other program residents and faculty from the other Johnston Memorial Hospital AEGD sites as well during seminars and lectures.\u00a0\r\nWhile it is unfortunate that so many patients in our community are in need of our low-cost dental services, our residents benefit from a very large patient base and high demand for dental services. This creates a rewarding experience for both patients and residents.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nResidents should anticipate a mix of comprehensive dental care patients and limited care \u201cemergency\u201d or episodic patients. The comprehensive care model will include most aspects of general dentistry and will be heavy in exodontia and IMPLANT supported prothesis construction, as these are the services most demanded by our patient base analysis, as determined by discussions with the sponsoring hospital and local dentists. Also, restorative work, endodontics, periodontics, and fixed prosthodontics will be required. The clinic will be busy, given our low prices, and residents will receive a mix of clinical experiences. Residents will also gain experience managing a variety of dental emergencies by seeing walk-in patients. These will include dental pain, infections, broken teeth, and other emergent presentations. Residents will diagnose and manage these cases, and this offers opportunities for referrals to specialists, when appropriate and in consultation with faculty.\r\nThe clinic is located in Bessemer, AL at\u00a0the Foundry Dental Center: \u00a0https://www.foundrydentalcenter.com\u00a0(click link).\u00a0\u00a0Our clinic is well-equipped with 14 dental chairs, digital x-rays, digital patient records, and a CBCT 3-D scanner.\u00a0\u00a0We are well staffed with 16 dental assistants, a nurse, and 2 laboratory technicians.\u00a0\u00a0We are open to the larger community but focused on treating recovering addicts enrolled in the Foundry Rescue Mission and Recovery Program.\u00a0\u00a0This is a faith based, long-standing recovery program in the Birmingham area.\u00a0\u00a0Information on the Birmingham and Bessemer area can be found here: \u00a0https://www.birminghamal.org.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nSome high-level Information on the Johnston Memorial Hospital AEGD program can be found here:\u00a0https://www.balladhealth.org/residencies/dental-aegd-abingdon-jmh. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The primary focus of this program is to improve the clinical skills taught in an undergraduate dental school program. The clinical and didactic training and experiences are at a level of skill and complexity beyond that accomplished in a pre-doctoral program. The program currently accepts three residents per year. Each resident is assigned a modern, well-equipped dental operatory and a full-time chair-side dental assistant. The facilities and staff support all clinical and educational activities of the program.Duty, Leave, Stipend\r\n\r\nAppointment: One full year, starting\u00a0July 1st\r\nHours of Duty: 7:30 A.M. to 4:00 P.M., Monday - Friday\r\nWeekend Call: None\r\nAnnual Leave: 13 days (vacation)\r\nStipend: Approximately $62,000\r\n\r\nClinical and Didactic Instruction\r\nClinical and didactic instruction covers the range of dental disciplines, emphasizing practice management and care for the medically compromised and dentally complex patients. Approximately 80% of time will be spent providing direct patient care and 20% will be directed toward non-clinical and didactic activities. 95% of our patients are outpatients.\u00a0 Upon satisfactory completion of the program, residents receive a certificate in Advanced Education in General Dentistry.\r\nThe resident has the opportunity to gain significant experience in all disciplines of dentistry with the exception of pediatric dentistry and orthodontics (limitations being placed on these by our regulating authorities).\u00a0 Location, availability of patients, and staffing direct the major emphasis of the program toward the management of medically compromised dental patients.\u00a0 Emphasis is placed on the dental disciplines of oral surgery, prosthodontics (fixed and removable), endodontics, and periodontics.\r\nThe program\u2019s objectives are to graduate residents that are able to:1. \u00a0Evaluate, diagnosis, manage and treat ambulatory, non-ambulatory and medically compromised patients through a multidisciplinary oral health care approach;2 \u00a0Function effectively within the hospital and other health care environments;3.\u00a0Continually strive to expand their dental knowledge base by critically reviewing literature and improving their clinical skills;4.\u00a0Evaluate and treat most dental emergencies;5.\u00a0Appreciate the importance of providing dental resources to the community (i.e. community service).\r\nThe didactic activities support the clinical aspects of the program.\u00a0 Seminars emphasize patient management and treatment planning.\u00a0 This is a continuing effort in day-to-day clinical operations and is reviewed on a periodic basis during treatment planning seminars, literature reviews, monthly patient care conferences and continuing education courses.\u00a0NYU Langone provides\u00a0online learning modules\u00a0covering a multitude of topics in\u00a0specialty and general dentistry. This comprises the majority of the didactic activity.\r\nThe clinical phase of the program comprises the bulk of the curriculum.\u00a0 Approximately 80% of resident time is spent in the Dental Service Clinic.At the completion of the program, residents are well-trained hospital dentists.\u00a0 They have a good command of general dentistry, are confident of their abilities, and know their limitations.\u00a0 The program provides them with a reasonable basis for future professional development in general dentistry or specialty training. \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The program includes preparation of the resident to:\r\n1.\u00a0 Achieve independent clinical ability in all phases of General Dentistry.\r\n2.\u00a0 Learn to treatment plan and provide complete dental health care for all patients including medically compromised patients.\r\n3.\u00a0 Learn practice management techniques in a health care environment.\r\n4.\u00a0 Function effective and efficiently in a hospital setting as a member of the health care team working with dental and medical specialists, and general practitioners.\u00a0 This also includes developing the resident\u2019s familiarity with hospital administration, organization, protocols, and interrelationships between various hospital departments.\r\n5.\u00a0 Apply information from literature reviews, lectures, and case presentations to clinical and oral health care.\r\n6.\u00a0 Understand the oral health needs of communities and participate in community service.\r\n7.\u00a0 Train and educate residents providing many modalities of education.\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

Graduates of the program are proficient in the anesthetic management \u2013 in both hospital and non-hospital settings \u2013 of a wide range of dental patients including: children, special needs patients, phobic adults, the medically compromised, patients with extensive treatment plans and the trauma patient.\nTo see a list of locations where Dental Anesthesiology is offered, click here.\n$68,082\n$71,754\n\nThe program began in July 2008 and in 2010 was fully accredited without reporting requirements by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Located in the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn, NYU Langone Hospitals-Brooklyn is recognized as a Level 1 Trauma Center. In this environment residents gain experience providing anesthesia services to a diverse mix of patients often presenting with significant comorbidities. The clinical and didactic components of the program are interwoven so that knowledge and theory are absorbed and retained in the crucible of real time anesthesia practice in a busy OR suite.\nOur goal is to provide our residents with the most effective combination of clinical and didactic instruction in dental anesthesiology. Upon graduation we expect our residents to be fully proficient in the anesthetic management of children, adults and the mentally and developmentally disabled or special needs patient \u2013 whether in the dental office, ambulatory surgicenter or inpatient setting.\nResidents who have graduated from this program practice as dental anesthesiologists in a wide variety of professional environments. These include mobile office-based anesthesia practices across the country, ambulatory surgicenters and a full-time anesthesia staff position in a children\u2019s hospital. Office-based anesthesia is a rapidly growing field that will continue to provide excellent practice opportunities for appropriately trained dental professionals.\nDental Anesthesiology residents participate in regular journal club sessions to keep abreast of current research and learn to use an evidence-based approach to critical reviews of the anesthesiology literature. Additionally, residents participate in an intense orientation lecture series as PGY-1 residents, in weekly grand rounds, and frequent lectures by faculty.\u00a0\nResidents complete a research project\u00a0under the guidance of the Director of Dental Research and present their findings at NYU Langone, ASDA/ADSA Meetings or other educational forums approved by the Program Director. Research projects may be: hypothesis-driven clinical research, formal case reviews/case studies or systematic reviews.\nResidents integrate evidence based findings into daily practice and strive for continual improvements in efficacy and safety of anesthesia services for dental patients throughout their residency and career.\nThis 36-month hospital-based program offers hands-on training in the anesthetic management of patients in the operating room, outpatient clinic and dental office setting.\u00a0NYU DA\u00a0Residents are trained in the full spectrum of anesthesia skills from intubated general anesthesia to IV/IM/oral sedation. \u00a0Much of the training occurs in the main OR suite at NYU Langone where residents are directly involved in providing anesthesia for a wide variety of general surgical cases. On a regular basis, Dental Anesthesiology residents take overnight call where they participate in emergency cases as part of the anesthesia team. First-year residents spend significant time training in the OR as well as on off-service rotations in medicine and pediatrics.\nSecond- and third-year residents continue rotation in the OR suite but also attend more focused clinical rotations. \u00a0Second-year residents spend two months on rotation in mobile office-based anesthesia. \u00a0In this rotation, residents spend time embedded in each of the practices of the dentist anesthesiologists associated with the rotation. \u00a0Second-year residents also spend two months on rotation in a surgery center dedicated to the anesthetic management of patients with special needs.\u00a0 In conjunction with the addition of the third-year to the Dental Anesthesiology Program curriculum, each PGY-3 DA residents spend four additional months on rotation in mobile office-based anesthesia.\nThe overall goal of the Dental Anesthesiology Program is to produce graduates that from day 1 are competent\u00a0 anesthesia providers in the dental office, ambulatory surgery center and Main OR suite settings.\nThe Dental Anesthesiology Program offers its postgraduate residents\u00a0generous stipends and fringe benefits which are competitive with other hospitals in the New York metropolitan area.\nThe application deadline is October 1st. The program uses the PASS application. Application materials may be obtained directly from the PASS website.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdditional correspondence may be obtained through:\nDr. Charles D.

{"title": "Craniofacial Fellowship Program | School of Dental Medicine | Case Western Reserve University", "body": "Dr. Valiathan completed his initial dental (BDS) and orthodontic training (MDS) at Manipal University, the #1 ranked dental school in India. He joined Case Western Reserve University in 1996 and re-trained in dentistry (DDS) and orthodontics (MSD). He is a tenured Associate Professor with appointments in the Departments of Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry and Plastic Surgery. Dr. Valiathan is the founding Program Director of the Surgical and Craniofacial Fellowship program, a program through Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals. He is an active contributor to the Craniofacial Biology Research Group at Case.\nFellows accepted into the Craniofacial and Special Care Orthodontics Fellowship Program will be provided with advanced clinical, didactic, and research training during the 1-year program of study in the management of children with facial differences. We anticipate most fellows to go through a 1-year program of study.\u00a0\nGraduates of the program will be exposed to the diagnoses, treatment planning, and clinical execution of orthodontic and dentofacial orthopedic services to a large clinical volume of pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients who have congenital and acquired craniofacial abnormalities. The goal of the program is to train the fellow to attain a level of competency that enables them to recognize, diagnose and treat patients with craniofacial anomalies and special needs in a hospital-based, team care setting.\nFellows participate in craniofacial and cleft conferences, review treatment plans and progress notes, and provide clinical care to patients under direct supervision. All complex treatments are discussed with the attending on a case-by-case basis. New patient exams are done on a regular basis and fellows work up cases (clinical exam, study models analysis, CBCT evaluations) and review the treatment plans with the faculty. The fellows will perform all surgical treatment plans, cephalometric prediction tracings, model surgery, and splint construction. They will also scrub in and participate in the OR activities/surgical procedures.\nRotations with other services will form an integral part of the program. The principal rotations will be with the departments of plastic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and pediatric dentistry. In addition, the fellow will be exposed to speech pathology, pediatric otolaryngology, genetics, and occupational therapy.\nThe format of the program allows for constant one-on-one supervision that will allow for subjective assessments of the fellow's understanding of the subject matter, clinical skills, and patient management skills. This will be supplemented by weekly sessions with the faculty, where their understanding will be further tested. At the end of each semester, a written examination will form part of the assessment of progress.\nMore information about admission to the program can be obtained by contacting the following:\nManish Valiathan, DDS, MSD, Program Director, at 216.368.0673\nDeb Tomsick, Craniofacial Clinic Coordinator, at 216.368.4331\nOR the Graduate Studies Administrator, at 216.368.1168\nAdmission requires MSD or equivalent degree from an accredited institution.\nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to see that all materials are submitted.\nRe-applicants must fully complete a new application and pay all fees.\nAdditional inquiries to the Office of Graduate Studies:\nCase Western Reserve University\nSchool of Dental Medicine\nSamson Pavilion\n10900 Euclid Ave -\u00a0Suite 439C\nCleveland, OH 44106\nPhone: 216.368.1168\nEmail: dentalgrad@case.edu\nEarly applications are recommended.

{"title": "Dental Public Health Residency Program | School of Dental Medicine | Case Western Reserve University", "body": "\"Dental Public Health is the science and art of preventing and controlling dental diseases and promoting dental health through organized community efforts. It is that form of dental practice which serves the community as a patient rather that the individual. It is concerned with the dental health education of the public, with applied dental research, and with the administration of group dental care programs as well as the prevention and control of dental diseases on a community basis\" (American Dental Association, 1976).\nThe Department of Community Dentistry at Case Western Reserve University offers both pre- and post-doctoral training in dental public health. Find more information about the pre-doctoral training.\nThe advanced education/residency program has three different tracks to meet various candidates' needs: one-year full-time or two-year part-time for dentists with a master's degree in public health (MPH) and a two-year full-time program for dentists without an MPH or equivalent. During the first year, students in the two-year fulltime program will primarily be working towards the accredited MPH program at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. During the second year, these students will be primarily engaged in the dental public health residency activities at the School of Dental Medicine and will also be completing any pending requirements of the MPH. Those successfully completing the advanced education program will be educationally qualified to take the examination of the American Board for Dental Public Health (ABDPH).\nThe Commission on Dental Accreditation has granted the accreditation status of \u201capproval without reporting requirements\u201d to the dental public health residency program at CWRU. The program is administered by an experienced program director and faculty members. The training program will be tailored to meet each individual resident\u2019s career goals and it will include didactic instruction, acquisition of research skills, and field experiences including community-oriented primary care. The primary training site is the School of Dental Medicine at CWRU, with extramural sites in other parts of Ohio. The field experience sites include the Greater Cleveland Free Medical Clinic, Akron Community Health Resources, Inc., among others. The didactic instruction for the residency program will encompass competencies of the American Board for Dental Public Health. Training will also include concepts such as population health, cultural competency, and health literacy. The field experience sites have been carefully chosen to increase residents\u2019 cultural sensitivity and understanding of minority groups. Trainees will have numerous opportunities to work with underserved populations such as the indigent, refugees, and minorities.\nThe city of Cleveland is a vibrant location for health care, primarily provided through the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. The Department of Community Dentistry\u2019s faculty members have expertise in dental public health, epidemiology, health services research, and behavioral sciences. Areas of research in the department include disparities in oral health, access to care, and survey research. Residents will have access to numerous learning opportunities that are available at CWRU, the premier research institution in Northeast Ohio. The residency program has excellent collaborations with the component schools/departments/centers at Case Western Reserve University: the School of Medicine\u2019s Departments of Family Medicine and Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics, Prevention Research Center, School of Social Work, etc. Residents will have the unique opportunity to contribute to the experiential learning of dental students that is also referred to as A Cornerstone Experience (ACE). One such ACE, the Healthy Smiles Sealant Program, offers an excellent service learning program to the first year dental students and is offered by the Department of Community Dentistry.

The program is accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA), a specialized accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education.\r\nThe Objective is to provide for the resident an advanced education and experience in all phases of dentistry with emphasis on the geriatric and medically compromised patient.\r\nThe program has four one-year residents each year. Residents spend approximately 75% of their time in the program treating the oral health needs of ambulatory patients. While in the dental clinic, the resident will rotate through Oral Surgery, Periodontics and Orthodontics\u00a0as well as General Dentistry.\r\nThe normal working hours are 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM. The AEGD Program is a one year residency which starts the\u00a0first week of\u00a0July and finishes the\u00a0first week of July.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nFacility, Location, Hospital\r\nThe Dayton VA Medical Center consists of a general medical, surgical, and psychiatric hospital with 120 beds located in a hospital building dedicated in 1992, a nursing home care unit with 265 beds, and a domiciliary with 115 beds, all combined under one management. It is located on a beautifully landscaped 382 acre tract at the western edge of Dayton.\r\nThere are approximately 1900 full time equivalent employees at the Medical Center. Our medical staff includes 71 physicians and\u00a08 staff dentists, in addition to physicians and dentist consultants.\r\nDental Clinic\r\nThe Dental Service provides comprehensive dental treatment to eligible Veterans in the main clinic located in the Patient Tower.\r\nThe modern dental clinic in the patient tower has: twelve general treatment chairs,\u00a0 two examination chairs, three hygiene chairs with a separate hygiene instruction room, two oral surgical suites, digital radiographic capability including Panorex, Cone Beam CT Scan, Cephalometrics, centralized sterilization, CAD/CAM,\u00a0conference room, and a large fully equipped \u00a0dental laboratory with digital scanning and 3D printing capibilities. \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The program is intended to enhance the resident's ability to formulate sequenced treatment plans. The AEGD program is designed to provide the new dental graduate with clinical experience in general dentistry as practiced in a hospital setting, as well as, an outpatient facility. Dental residents serve a one-year term at the Orlando VA Medical Center Dental Clinic. Particular emphasis is placed on the dental management of patients with systemic disease and the relationship of medical disorders to oral disease and dental care. The program allows the resident to practice working effectively with other health professionals in a hospital environment and gives them an opportunity to refine and advance knowledge and skills in clinical dentistry. The AEGD resident will receive advanced training in recognized dental specialties and various medical services.\r\nPatients eligible for treatment are assigned to the residents for comprehensive care. Due to the nature of dental eligibility, a resident's opportunity to complete a comprehensive treatment plan for an eligible patient is not based upon the patient's ability to pay for their dental care. Therefore, the dental resident will have ample opportunity to render fixed prosthodontic care, as well as molar endodontics and periodontal surgery. All aspects of dentistry are practiced with the exception of pediatric and orthodontic dentistry. Quarterly evaluations assure a good caseload mix. Residents also treat patients presenting for emergency care.\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

{"title": "Endodontics (ENDO) Program at NYU Langone", "body": "The COVID-19 vaccination is a requirement for employment at NYU Langone, unless you have been approved for an exemption\u00a0by NYU Langone.\u00a0\nThis ADA-CODA accredited 25-month program is a hybrid blend of both hospital- and dental school-based training. The program emphasizes orthograde and surgical clinical endodontics. Residents who successfully complete the program are granted a certificate in endodontics and meet eligibility requirements for the American Board of Endodontics examination.\nTo see a list of locations where Endodontics is offered, click here.\n3 NY/3 PR\n$37,652\nIn July 2005, NYU Langone Dental Medicine's Advanced Education in Endodontics Program established\u00a0its fully ADA-CODA accredited twenty-five (25)-month Advanced Specialty Education Program in Endodontics in Brooklyn, New York. The program added an additional endodontic training site in 2009 in San Juan, Puerto Rico at the University of Puerto Rico School of Dental Medicine (UPR).\u00a0The addition of the training site in PR made the Endodontic Program the first to have multiple training sites.\u00a0 All residents including those based in PR receive their certificate from NYU Langone Dental Medicine Postdoctoral Residency Programs.\nUse of all current technologies and methodologies is encouraged while conducting numerous endodontical procedures including; surgical operating microscopes, a variety of rotary instruments, cone beam computed tomography and ultrasonics. All attending endodontists who oversee residents are concurrently private sector practitioners who are well-steeped in the most advanced endodontic practices. This affords residents exposure to clinicians with many years of private practice experience. In addition, residents have an opportunity to observe attendings at their private offices. With a large and ethnically diverse patient population unique to\u00a0NYU Langone Dental Medicine's Advanced Education in Endodontics Program hospital training sites, residents can expect to conduct diverse procedures, work with specialists in orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics, oral surgery, oral pathology, endodontics, orofacial pain and periodontics. Residents also learn techniques to treat patients with special needs and medically complex conditions.\nFirst-year residents participate in relevant aspects of the core curriculum. These include embryology, infectious and immunological processes in health and disease, oral medicine, and pharmacotherapeutics.\nIn addition, endodontic residents attend an in-depth course in methods and materials for research.\nThis covers:\nThese residents, together with medical residents and dental residents throughout our other dental residency programs, complete a research project under the continuing guidance of the Office of Clinical\u00a0Research and present their findings at the Annual Research Fair held every Spring.\nEndodontic residents participate in regular literature review sessions to keep abreast of current research\u00a0and learn to use an evidence-based approach to critical reviews of the endodontic literature. Residents learn to integrate research into daily practice and lay the foundation for a lifetime dedicated to providing scientifically based endodontic services for dental patients.\nThe endodontic curriculum includes diagnosis and treatment planning, outcome evaluation, surgical and non-surgical endodontic treatment and re-treatment, immunology, and microbiology.\nThe program uses a distance learning curriculum of structured lectures and learning activities that occur via live video teleconference (VTC) and asynchronous web-based modules (Brightspace).\u00a0The VTC didactic learning program allows endodontic residents, whether in Brooklyn or Puerto Rico, to collaborate with each other as well as with residents and faculty located at all extramural training sites in every NYU Langone Dental Medicine residency program throughout the United States. As part of the VTC sessions, endodontic residents prepare, share and present interesting and unique cases for group discussion. Endodontic residents receive the same didactic lectures and literature review via live weekly video teleconferencing.\nResidents complete a research project and may participate in a poster presentation at our research fair held each spring.\u00a0Research initiatives may lead to a publishable paper. The research symposiums throughout the first and second year guide the residents through their research. In addition, residents gain invaluable experience during a teaching rotation. During the last few months of training, the residents visit a number of private endodontic dental offices to observe and acquire real-world experience in practice management and practice administration.\nResidents receive a generous stipend and fringe benefits consistent with other Endodontic programs in hospitals in the New York Metropolitan and Puerto Rico geographies.\nThe application deadline is August 1st for NY and September 1st for Puerto Rico. The program uses the PASS application but does not use the MATCH process. Application materials may be obtained from the PASS program website www.adea.org/PASSapp.\nNYU Langone Dental MedicineAttention: Dr. Robert GoldbergerStation 21150 55th StreetBrooklyn, NY 11220Robert.Goldberger@nyulangone.org\n\nNY State Applicants Only-Graduates with an international dental degree\u00a0AND\u00a0a U.S. or Canadian DDS/DMD degree:For applicants who have earned BOTH a dental degree from a non-US or Canadian school, AND a US or Canadian DDS/DMD program, your education must be approved by the NY State Department of Education for your application to be considered.

This program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association\u2019s Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA).\nThe highly respected research environment at Penn Dental Medicine and throughout the University of Pennsylvania provides a valuable opportunity for students applying to residency programs to combine their training with advanced research and academic opportunities. To that end, Penn Dental Medicine offers a Master of Science in Oral Biology (MSOB) and a Doctor of Science in Dentistry (DScD) that can be earned concurrent with a certificate, preparing students to successfully enter the field of academic dentistry while also becoming skilled clinicians in care. Through the MSOB and DScD programs, students are encouraged to pursue their individual research interests with projects that can span the diverse disciplines and research labs within Penn Dental Medicine\u2019s basic and clinical sciences and across the University. Join us for a DScD program virtual open house March 16\u00a0\u00bb\nStudents in the residency program are exposed to the many facets of modern clinical endodontics with an emphasis on the utilization of the microscope in all types of procedures, including emergency treatment, complex conservative treatment, microsurgery, pediatric endodontics, and the treatment of traumatic injuries to teeth. All residents must conduct and prepare an independent research project for presentation at the Annual Session of the American Association of Endodontists and for publication.\nIn addition to the core basic science courses required for all postgraduate students, the endodontic department arranges further basic science courses related to the program. Clinical seminars, planned reading seminars, and an extensive guest lecture series are also part of the educational experience.\nAcademic Track: MSOB and certificate (3 years), DScD and certificate (5 years)\nClinical Certificate Track: certificate only (2 years)\nNumber of residents accepted: 8 per year\nThe program has a strong clinical component \u2013 approximately 50 percent of the time is spent in the clinic, affording a broad-based clinical experience in conventional and surgical endodontic treatment. Residents work in their operatories, equipped with an operating microscope all the latest instruments and materials necessary to practice modern endodontics. Highly skilled members of the endodontic community staff the program. Under their supervision, residents develop advanced nonsurgical and surgical endodontic skills; use a variety of techniques and technologies, including the surgical operating microscope; and develop a unique endodontic treatment philosophy.\nApplication Deadline: August 1 \u2014 See Graduate Dental Education Programs Admissions Requirements and Procedures for detailed information and instructions.\nAll applications will be reviewed by the Endodontics Admissions Selection Committee. Late or incomplete applications will not be considered. Decisions to interview applicants will be made by the Endodontics Admissions Section Committee and such decisions will be communicated to applicants directly from the Endodontics Department.\nA personal interview is required as part of the selection process. Selected applicants will be invited to interview at Penn Dental Medicine. Approximately 40 applicants are invited to interview. Interview invitations will be sent via email starting late August. Interviews will be conducted at the School beginning late August. Travel and lodging information will be included with the interview invitation. The interview day will consist of interviews with department faculty, a tour of the facilities, and lunch with faculty and other invited candidates.\nThe Endodontics Program does not participate in the Match Process. Accepted candidates will be notified via telephone call on a rolling basis until the entering class reaches capacity. All admitted candidates are obligated to submit a non-refundable acceptance deposit in the amount of $1,000 within ten business days of acceptance.

The Medical Center is close to the junctions of the 118 and 405 freeways. The street location is at the corner of Plummer Street and Woodley. The main gate is on Plummer Street with one alternate gate on Woodley Ave. California State University at Northridge is located in the near vicinity. Our university affiliation is with UCLA School of Dentistry.\r\nAt SACC, complete health care services are provided in dentistry, medicine, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychology, social work and surgery. There are over 50 nursing home patients admitted to the nursing home per year and approximately 220,000 outpatient treatment visits per year\r\nThe population treated within the VA hospital setting has significant dental needs. Concomitantly, patients typically have an array of debilitating physical, psychological, and medical conditions that complicate their dental treatment. The staff and residents are highly trained in the management of these complex and difficult patients. The spectrum of dental care ranges from unscheduled emergency procedures to comprehensive evaluation and treatment of eligible inpatients and outpatients, which encompasses virtually all specialty areas in dentistry. Many of the patients admitted to the hospital and nursing home are given routine examinations or referred for dental related problems. Special emphasis is placed on providing treatment to patients with dental conditions associated with or exacerbating compelling medical problems, such as head and neck cancer, spinal cord injury, diabetes, cardiac valvular dysfunction, vascular grafts, orthopedic prostheses, and implants utilizing synthetic materials.\r\nThe Dental Service enjoys support from other services within the Medical Center, such as radiology and laboratory. Additionlaly, it provides broad consultative services to ENT, Radiation Therapy, Orthopedics, Psychiatry, Medicine and the Nursing Home Care Unit. Associated functions and activities of the Dental Service include resident training and patient education.\r\nThe Dental Service is staffed by 10 full-time and part-time dentists, including full-time specialists in endodontics, prosthodontics, periodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery and\u00a06 residents (a combination of PGY1 and PGY2 general practice), 1 part-time laboratory technicisn, 2 hygienists and 12 dental assistants.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The program is intended to enhance the resident\u2019s ability to formulate a sequenced treatment plan that integrates the various medical disciplines and dental specialties into the practice of advanced general dentistry. The GPR resident will receive advanced training in the recognized dental specialties and various medical services. The teaching faculty consists of generalists and board eligible or certified dental specialists representing a broad spectrum of dental expertise.\r\nThe General Practice Residency Program is designed to provide the new dental graduate with clinical experience in general dentistry as practiced in a hospital setting. Dental Residents serve a one-year term at the VA Palo Alto Dental Clinic.\u00a0 Particular emphasis is placed on the dental management of patients with systemic disease, and the interrelationship of medical disorders to oral disease. The program provides opportunities for the residents to learn how to work effectively with adjunct health professionals within the hospital environment, and to advance their knowledge and skills in clinical dentistry.\r\nClinical experience and some advanced training is provided in preventive dentistry, implantology, operative, fixed and removable prosthodontics, geriatric dentistry, periodontics, endodontics, oral surgery, and oral pathology. \r\nOff-service assignments include rotations to: anesthesia, emergency and \u00a0general medicine, ENT and Stanford University Medical Center.\u00a0 Didactic \u00a0training in subjects including:\u00a0oral pathology, oral surgery, physical diagnosis, implantology, endodontics, periodontics, financial planning, ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and emergency patient management.\u00a0 \r\nResidents will\u00a0gain experience\u00a0managing dental emergencies and taking after hours CALL at both the VA Palo Alto and at Stanford.\r\nResidents will have the opportunity present clinical case presentations to the dental faculty, and their co-residents.\r\nThe General Practice Residency Program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association. \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The program is staffed by two full time dentists. We have about 20 part time attendings in most specialties that attend the clinic bi-weekly. We have financial assistance programs available to eliminate financial barriers to our patient population. Rotations consist of Medicine and\u00a0Anesthesia. Continuing education consists of attending the Yankee Dental Conference\u00a0and 7 CSDA day lectures. Hartford Hospital is a level I trauma center and our residents will support the ED on a limited on call basis. Each resident will have their own operatory and dedicated dental assistant\u00a0(90% of the time). We have five positions available. What we look for in the ideal candidate is an open minded graduate who has the\u00a0passion, enthusiasm, and the willingness to learn. We accept the PASS application. All references should be submitted through PASS. We accept only US/Canadian Dental school graduates (Puerto Rico also included). We offer shadowing positions to any candidate that is interested in our program.

The program provides the recent graduate the opportunity to augment his/her/they knowledge of oral disease and his/her/they diagnostic and therapeutic skills in dentistry. Treatment of oral disease in the medically complex patient and/or hospitalized patient is emphasized. A private practice environment is maintained throughout the program to assist the recent dental school graduate in the successful transition from academics to \"real world dentistry\".\r\nIn alignment with MAHEC\u2019s mission, the General Practice Residency (GPR) program offers the opportunity for residents to build their clinical skills in a community health setting while obtaining a Master of Public Health degree (MPH) from the UNC Gillings School's Master of Public Health Program in Asheville. The two year GPR-MPH track is the perfect opportunity for those considering a career in general dentistry and interested in understanding oral health from both a clinician and policy-maker\u2019s perception. Obtaining a degree while practicing dentistry enables the general dentist to assimilate the public health paradigm into their practice and have mentors teach them how to use it to engage their patients and community. This track offers the tools for those interested in becoming not only general practitioners, but also leaders in government agencies, private sector organizations and universities.\r\nResidents will be admitted to the GPR program through the standard process and UNC Gillings\u00a0School will conduct their own admission process.

We do not accept any type of visa.\r\n- Selection is based on application information sent via PASS.\r\n- A TOEFL score above 80 is required, as well as NDBE parts I and II or INBDE.\r\n- The admission consists of a three-step process. First, the applications submitted to PASS are evaluated. Qualifying applicants are then selected for a personal interview.

Residents will have exposure to a diverse patient population and a variety of patient cases, which helps them learn to better manage their time as they progress through the year. Residents have the opportunity to work alongside and learn from many general dentists and specialists, including oral surgeons, endodontists, and periodontists. Residents will act as a primary oral healthcare provider and gain experience in providing emergency &amp; comprehensive oral healthcare, obtaining informed consent, functioning within interdisciplinary healthcare teams, providing patient-focused care, providing health education, and engaging in disease prevention activities.\r\nOur residency program is flexible to align with the goals and interests of each individual resident. If residents have an interest in a particular area of dentistry, they can work with the program directors to align their experience with their professional goals.\r\nOur GPR is designed to provide in depth clinical experiences in oral surgery, endodontics, periodontal treatment (both surgical and non surgical), prosthodontics (both fixed and removable), and cosmetic dentistry (both direct and indirect) using composite and e.max non-metallic crowns and veneers.\u00a0Additionally, residents will have the opportunity to assist in the placement and restoration of implants.\u00a0 Residents treat special needs and medically compromised patients in the operating room every week.\u00a0 Treatment planning and case presentations are a vital part of resident experiences.\u00a0 In addition to rotations through cardiology, family medicine,\u00a0geriatric medicine, and\u00a0anesthesia, academic lectures are presented by hospital sub-specialties.\u00a0\r\nThe medical rotations\u00a0our dental residents experience provide an education in patient dental care which most recent graduates do not receive in dental school.

{"title": "General Practice Residency Program | School of Dental Medicine", "body": "Take the Pledge\nThe General Practice Residency (GPR) Program, sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), offers a one-year program that provides residents with postdoctoral clinical and didactic experiences. Based in the UPMC Montefiore Dental Center on the UPMC Presbyterian/Shadyside Campus, the program enrolls a combined total of three (3) residents each year. Residents completing the GPR earn a Certificate of Training.\nGuided by the philosophy that oral health is an integral and interactive aspect of total health, residents engage in approximately nine months of comprehensive dental care.\u00a0 The remaining three months are spent on rotations in anesthesia, emergency medicine, internal medicine, and oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nIn addition to intensive exposure to hospital-based dentistry, the program provides clinical and didactic training across a range of dental specialties, including endodontics, periodontics, implant dentistry, prosthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral pathology/oral medicine, head and neck oncology patients, transplant and cardiothoracic surgery patients \u00a0and treating patients with complex medical histories. Instruction is also provided in ancillary topics pertinent to dental practice, such as patient evaluation and physical examination, emergency medical care, treatment of traumatic dental injuries, inpatient care and hospital organization, and a multitude of other medical and dental subjects.\nIn addition to the delivery of clinical care in the UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Dental Center and Hospital, the residents will rotate through the UPMC Mercy Hospital Emergency Department, Catholic Charities of Pittsburgh Free Care Dental Center and The University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine Interdisciplinary Implant Center.\nJournal Club, treatment planning conferences, resident portfolios and off-site local and national dental meetings are also part of the program content. \nResidents will be required to provide 24-hour, on-call emergency services as scheduled by the residency director. Short-range and long-range pagers will be provided to each resident. Residents are not often required to remain in-house, but usually take call from home. \nThe General Practice Dental Residency Program is designed to provide training beyond the level of pre-doctoral education in oral health care, using applied basic and behavioral sciences.\u00a0 Education in this program is based on the concept that oral health is an integral and interactive part of total health.\u00a0 The program is designed to expand the scope and depth of the residents\u2019 knowledge and skills to enable them to provide comprehensive oral health care to a wide range of population groups.\u00a0 The goals of this program are derived from the Commission on Dental Accreditation\u2019s (CODA) Standards for Advanced Education Programs in General Practice Residency.\nSpecific to the UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Dental Center General Practice Residency Program, the program will prepare each resident to:\nThe UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Dental Center is a resident-driven clinic. Residents must be supervised either directly or indirectly, with direct supervision immediately available (i.e. attending dentist is in the hospital or other site of care and is immediately available to provide direct supervision). Much of the learning process and the development of progressive responsibility is based on teaching by example under supervision. Supervision and close observation provide the ability of the program director to ascertain when a resident is ready and able to assume progressive autonomy and responsibility. Each resident must know the limits of their scope of authority and the circumstances under which they are permitted to act with conditional independence as well as their skill set and experience. Attending doctors always maintain professionalism within this relationship and will encourage residents to practice with increasing autonomy while freely seeking guidance from the attending at any time the resident believes it to be helpful to the care of the patient. This relationship is designed to be reciprocal and fundamental to the residents\u2019 successful progression. \nThose interested in making application to the program may do so through the\u00a0American Dental Education Association\u2019s Postdoctoral Application Support Service (PASS).\u00a0 This program participates in the National Dental Match. \nFor additional information about the application process, please contact \nAndrea Ford\nCoordinator, UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Hospital\nOMFS/GPR Dental Residency Programs\nfordam@upmc.edu\n412-648-6801\nOctober 15 of each year\nWhile in the program, residents receive UPMC Health System\u2019s postgraduate trainee stipend.\u00a0\nBenefits include 10 days (80 hours) paid time off, 3 days (24 hours) of paid time off for job-search-related activities, healthcare insurance for the trainee and dependents. The option is also offered for inclusion in 401K, healthcare spending account, dependent care savings accounts and other modest benefits. \nResearch is encouraged and supported, but not a formal part of the program.\nIf you would like to make an appointment, or have a question about your treatment here, please contact our patient care coordinators at\u00a0412-648-6730.\nIf you are a dentist or physician who would like to refer a patient to the UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Dental Center, please call 412-648-6328 or fax the referral to 412-648-6505.\n\u00a0\nElizabeth C.

The goal of such a program is to provide the type of training that will give the dental resident an understanding of the relationships of dental treatment to all other aspects of total health care. The resident thus gains valuable experience by following the clinical progress of primary care patients, as well as those with conditions not commonly seen or recognized in the clinic of a dental school.

{"title": "General Practice Residency | School of Dentistry", "body": "The MHealth/University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC) General Practice Residency Program is designed to expand the scope and depth of the graduates\u2019 knowledge and skills to enable them to provide comprehensive oral health care to a wide range of population groups, with an emphasis on the medically, cognitively, and physically challenged patient.\nThe General Practice Residency is a 12-month, CODA-accredited, hospital-based residency program that leads to a Certificate from the University of Minnesota Medical Center. In addition to instruction and experience in all areas of dentistry, residents learn to function effectively in the hospital environment. They become adept at providing care for traumatic dental injuries and infections, delivering care in the operating room, and providing in-patient consults and supportive care for patients undergoing complex medical procedures including organ transplants and treatment for oral cancer. Residents also gain extensive experience in managing after-hours dental emergencies.\nThe clinical component of the program is supported by a didactic program that includes formal courses, seminars and lectures in both dental and medical topics, including surgical placement of dental implants, management of TMD/Orofacial Pain patients, geriatric dentistry, practice management, oral medicine, radiology, conscious sedation, history and physical examination, and practice management. Literature reviews and case presentation/treatment planning conferences are scheduled on a semi-monthly basis throughout the year. Residents also participate in monthly multi-disciplinary treatment planning seminars with other specialty programs, and quarterly hospital dentistry-focused conferences with Oral Maxillofacial Surgery and Pediatric Dentistry residents.\u00a0\nOver the course of the year Residents are assigned to off-service rotations in Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine (2 weeks each), Anesthesiology (3 weeks), and Oral Surgery (4 weeks). Each of these rotations provides residents with the opportunity to observe the delivery of health care from the perspective of these disciplines and to actively participate as a member of an interdisciplinary health care team.\nExpand all\nProspective students apply using the\u00a0ADEA PASS Application\u00a0and the\u00a0National Matching Service\u00a0(MATCH). Applications are due in early November, and interviews take place in November and December.\u00a0\nAll applicants must have a DDS or DMD from a CODA-accredited dental school located in the United States or Canada by the start of the program, on July 1 each year.\u00a0\nThe program offers an optional second-year position as Chief Resident. The resident completes a master\u2019s program or focuses on hospital rotations such as radiation oncology, OMFS, head and next surgery and organ transplant.\nThere are three components to the GPR curriculum:\nDirector of GPR Program\nJeffrey Stefani, DDS\nUniversity of Minnesota Physicians Dental Clinic\nRiverside Professional Building - West Bank\n606 24th Ave. S., Suite 200\nMinneapolis, MN 55454\n612-659-8695[email\u00a0protected]"},

It includes outpatient and inpatient care. There are eleven(11) first-year positions and one\u00a0chief resident position. The facilities at both practices (Jacobi and NCB) afford an excellent opportunity to learn and practice all phases of dentistry under the direction of highly accomplished practitioners.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0Jacobi Medical Center Campus is comprised of Jacobi Medical Center and the Rose F. Kennedy Center. Jacobi Hospital (Bldg #1) is the primary site utilized for emergency care, oral surgery training, and operating room experience. JMC and NCB are the major sites of comprehensive ambulatory dental care for adults and children. The Rose F. Kennedy Center\u00a0(Bldg #3) delivers dental care to patients with developmental disabilities.\u00a0North Central Bronx (NCB) Hospital is several minutes away and accessible by hospital shuttle.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nJacobi Medical Center is designated as a Level 1 trauma center. This means that the residents have unique opportunities to work with emergency room personnel and dental residents treating patients who have sustained maxillo-facial trauma including dentoalveolar fractures, lacerations etc. Located on Pelham Parkway, across the street from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Jacobi Medical Center serves the community residents in this urban landscaped area of the Bronx. The population is mixed lower and middle class with a variety of dental insurance plans. General practice residents will gain broad experience in a variety of specialties including endodontics(rotary, vertical obturation), periodontics (including surgery), laser dentistry, extensive oral surgery and implant prosthodontics including placement and restoration of single-unit implants. Additionally, residents will provide multiple units and full arch hybrid implant restorations.\u00a0 The program is designed to provide the resident a challenging and diverse clinical experience and grow in confidence while under the guidance of experienced practitioners. There is a comprehensive didactic program covering all specialty topics in addition to case presentations, journal clubs, ethical issues, practice management and presentations from vendors in the dental field.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nResidents provide treatment working with dental assistants to provide four-handed dentistry. The clinics utilize an electronic dental record, digital radiographs including pan/ceph, lasers, cone beam technology, microscope for endodontics and digital scanning.\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

This was the first dental school in the nation to become part of a state university. In 1927 its name was changed to the School of Dentistry. Both its longevity and its university relationship have enabled the School to become a leader in the dental profession.\nThe School has grown larger in student body and facilities over the years. In 1969 it entered a period of change and expansion greater than at any previous time in its history, with the addition of a new building attached to the original School of Dentistry Kellogg Building. The curriculum was also updated to reflect the immense growth in science and technology that impacted upon the dental profession.\nAt present, the School of Dentistry facility supports pre-doctoral and graduate programs in dentistry and dental hygiene, a year-around postgraduate education program, a Dental Research Institute, and an extensive dental library.\nThe residents may participate in continuing education programs, formal graduate courses and seminar series that takes place at the School of Dentistry. In addition, there are opportunities for the residents to interact with graduate students in other programs at the School of Dentistry, including Periodontics, Prosthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, Orthodontics and Endodontics Programs. The residents will be given the opportunity to consult with any faculty member at the School of Dentistry, and individualized continuing education programs can be arranged with faculty.\nThe University of Michigan Medical Center was established in 1850. The new University Hospital, renamed \u2018The University of Michigan Health Systems\u2019, which opened February 14, 1986, currently contains 913 beds and includes three hospitals, approximately 30 health centers and 120 outpatient clinics. These all offer the latest technology and equipment along with a pleasing and comfortable environment. The University Hospital is a Level 1 Trauma Center. Face trauma call is shared by Plastic Surgery, Otolaryngology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\nThe Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery/Hospital Dentistry outpatient clinic is located on the second floor of the Med Inn Building.

The Sisters of Mercy are committed to making a difference in the lives of the people they serve.

These educational programs are designed to provide the residents with additional exposure to both medical and dental problems and developments. The following programs are regularly scheduled for the resident's benefit:\nEducational seminars presented by the attending staff, guest lecturers or medical/dental specialists will focus on advanced techniques in the individual's specialty or interest areas. Educational seminars presented by the residents will focus on management of dental patients with special needs or complex management and also on implant placement/restoration patient cases.\nOral pathology conferences are presented by an oral pathologist. The conferences review and augment the resident's knowledge of oral and general pathology as well as oral medicine.\nOral surgery conferences are presented by various medical or oral surgery attending staff or residents. The subjects covered include a variety of dental and medical problems, techniques important to diagnosis and management of patients and techniques or problems in oral surgery. Seminar subjects will cover basic and special considerations for inpatient and outpatient care of dental patients undergoing combined medical and dental procedures. Principles of fluid balance, laboratory interpretation, pain management, TMJ disorders, infection and medication management are just a few examples of subjects presented. A physical assessment course is also provided through the Oral Surgery Service.\u00a0\nA 12-week lecture course on a restorative approach to implants is also provided with the oral surgeons\u2014this addresses both surgical and restorative aspects of implant placement and restorative. Weekly implant case conferences are held at the VA amongst the prosthodontist, generalists, oral surgeons and residents to discuss cases prior to implant placement and to achieve the best results surgically and restoratively.\u00a0\nTreatment planning/case review seminars are weekly presentations of difficult or unusual dental patients. The residents are requested to present the patient's medical and dental problems, how they affect the patient and his/her treatment, and what treatment was prescribed and carried out. The program focuses the majority of its didactic efforts into the Monday afternoon treatment planning and case conference. The conference has associated with it operative dentistry, prosthodontia, practice management, literature reviews, professional ethics, ethical dilemmas\u00a0and systemic disease in dentistry lectures on a rotation basis. Supplemental guest lectures are also provided on topics of interest to the program; TMD, Implants, etc.\nEmergency On-Call Each dental resident is assigned to emergency on-call duty by the program co-directors. Dental residents will alternate call as scheduled and will on occasion support the oral surgery residents in order to gain trauma experience. Dental residents will be expected to provide palliative care to patients admitted to the Emergency Room. The experience will include common general dental problems as well as minor and major traumatic injuries. Residents will not be required to stay on-site when on call.\nOff-Site RotationsResidents will spend two weeks in the Anesthesia rotation and two weeks in a rotation of Emergency Medicine. The length of the VA rotation is dependent upon the total number of residents in the program and currently is six months in duration.\u00a0A portion of the VA rotation will be held at the facility in Grand Island, Nebraska. Additional rotations are available in pediatric dentistry, oral maxillofacial prosthodontics or any other area of interest within the hospital.\u00a0\nThe resident's rotations will be supervised by the various attending staff and residents on the specific services. The residents are expected to participate in patient care while on rotation and assist the physicians or oral surgeons during procedures and examinations. The rotations are designed to increase the resident's exposure to clinical medicine and allow them to utilize and apply diagnostic skills learned during their training in the residency program.\nImmunizationsThe University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry policy requires that all entering students in programs requiring patient contact must be vaccinated or exhibit active immunity to tetanus, measles*, mumps, diphtheria, chicken pox, polio, rubella and Hepatitis B and have had a TB skin test within the last six months, unless the student has a previous positive test/medical contraindication.

This merger of the\u00a0three individual hospital based General Practice Residencies created a greater depth of faculty talent and resources for our program, further strengthening patient care and resident clinical and didactic education.\r\nThe One Brooklyn Health GPR has dental centers in each of the hospitals campuses and in three offsite centers located in the ethnically diverse and historic Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bedford Stuyvesant,Crown Heights and East New York.\r\nThe Department of Dental Medicine which has been in existence for over 60 years offers a full spectrum of dental services. Our residents are trained by General Practitioners and Board Eligible/Certified Specialists.\r\nOur modern dental centers are equipped with state of the art digital imaging systems including CBCT and a self-contained ambulatory OR suite.\r\nThe General Practice Residency is designed to provide training beyong the pre-doctoral level. The program meets and exceeds all standards required by the Commission on Dental Accreditation and is fully accredited without reporting requirements.\r\nOur educational model is based on the concept that oral health is an integral and interactive part of one's total health. Residents are exposed to a broad range of clinical experiences encompassing all general dental procedures including: restorative,fixed/removable prosthetics, periodontics, oral surgery, orthodontics, endodontics, implant placement and restoration, oral pathology and dental treatment of special needs patients in the OR and under IV sedation. The program will expand the scope and the depth of the residents knowledge and skill set enabling them to provide comprehensive oral care.\r\nCODA required rotations in Internal Medicine, Anesthesia and Emergency Medicine; along with scholarly activity, participation in organized dentistry and community service are integral aspects of our program.\r\nFrom daily didactic lectures and journal reviews to in-depth instruction on diagnosis, treatment planning and comprehensive care, residents complete the program with a solid foundation and confidence.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

There are 6 resident positions open each year, one of which is for the optional second year. The program is sponsored by NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and is affiliated with the College of Dental Medicine.\r\nThe General Practice Residency Program works very closely with the College of Dental Medicine's Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and strives to provide an outstanding experience in hospital dentistry. Our purpose is to offer a training program in comprehensive multidisciplinary oral health care at a level of skill and complexity beyond that achieved in predoctoral training. The program emphasizes resident training in clinical examination, diagnosis, treatment planning, and provision of sequenced comprehensive care that addresses the patient's needs, desires, and limitations. This training is focused on patients with very complex medical histories, developmental disabilities, and geriatric medical complications. There is a strong emphasis on providing dental care to members of our local community.\r\nThe General Practice Residency program is part of the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Dental Service, which admits and discharges its own patients. The Hospital Dental Service residents are house staff officers with the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as other hospital residents. The Hospital Dental Service is called upon regularly by the other hospital services to provide consultation and treatment.\r\nAttendings and resident house staff perform inpatient and ambulatory surgery in the operating room and provide outpatient care to patients from the medical center and the local community in the hospital dental service clinic and faculty practice. Patients are treated in a caring, comprehensive manner in collaboration with an exceptionally respected group of medical and dental professionals.\r\nRounds and on-call are a strong medical teaching component of the program. The General Practice Resident goes on morning rounds and takes on-call in accordance with hospital guidelines. When a General Practice Resident is on-call they have the same responsibilities as that of a first-year Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery resident.\r\nThe didactic component of the program and the general dentistry clinic are operated under the auspices of the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine.\r\nThe program offers a second-year position for residents who are interested in an additional year of training. Second-year residents treat more complex patients and have the opportunity to spend more time on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service.

The goal of the General Practice Residency program is to help the graduate dentist gain experience so that he/she may provide a high level of comprehensive dental care to patients with a variety of needs. Didactic and clinical skills are reinforced as our residents are trained in all aspects of dental care including prosthodontics, endothontics, orthodontics, periodontics, pedodontics, implantology, pain, anxiety control, myofacial pain dysfunction, TMJ dysfunction, oral surgery, management of the medically compromised and special needs patient, inpatient care/management, emergency room care, medical risk assessment, and physical diagnosis. In addition, residents participate in practice management activities and community service through their participation in health fairs and special school programs to help prevent and reduce the incidence of oral disease.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn addition, residents do a\u00a0two week rotation in the Anesthesia Department where patient assessment, venipuncture, airway management, post-op assessment, pharmacology and sedation techniques are covered. The anesthesia rotation is followed by a two week Emergency room rotation where residents obtain experience in diagnosis, and managment of Medical emergencies. \u00a0Residents are required to provide emergency room dental coverage on an ongoing rotating basis to further enrich their experience in the treatment and management of dental trauma and emergencies.

training program through our didactic program and clinical services. This basic format provides the foundation for the goals and objectives we have established for each of the subspecialties. \u00a0Each resident is expected to become conversant in oral diagnosis and treatment planning along with an excellent working knowledge of dental subspecialties associated with general practice (i.e. periodontics, pediatric dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics, oral surgery, oral medicine, implantology and orthodontics).\r\nOne of our primary goals for each resident to provide comprehensive and emergency services for people with multiple or complicated medical conditions and to be able to access, first hand, all necessary information to treat these patients.\u00a0 Our goal is to familiarize the resident with terminology used in describing, discussing and researching so they are proficient in assessing the patients\u2019 health and to quickly and appropriately respond to patients needs in emergency situations. The resident must develop a sensitivity about the dental care of the indigent, the patient who is developmentally disabled and all medically compromised patients.\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

nationally accredited teaching hospital located in Nassau County, Long Island, less than 30 miles east of Manhattan. \u00a0The mission of the General Dentistry Residency training program at NUMC is to provide post-graduate level instruction and practice in all areas of dentistry in order to faciliate the development of responsible, ethical and experienced professionals who will be both competent and comfortable entering the private and/or public health care sector upon completion of the program. \u00a0\r\nThe main goals of the General Practice Residency program at NUMC are to: \r\ni) continue to expand upon the skills acquired in dental schoolii) facilitate the development of confidence and speed in both clinical skills and treatment planningiii) communicate effectively with and work closely within a multi-disciplinary health care teamiv) expose the resident to a diverse patient population, including inpatients and patients with special needs.\r\nDuring this one-year program, the resident will work closely on the clinic floor with specialists from all disciplines, including but not limited to endodontics, oral surgery, pedodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics and orthodontics. \u00a0The didactic training consists of weekly lectures given by specialists and general dentistry faculty, case presentations, and literature reviews. \u00a0Because Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is the only other post-graduate dental residency programs sponsored by NUMC, the general practice residents are offered the unique opportunity to handle complex cases as first-year residents. \u00a0Such cases include treatment planning and restoration of implants, full-mouth dental rehabilitation, orthodontic cases (including wire and bracket placement by the resident), and dentistry in an operating room setting, with the patient under general anesthesia. \u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n

well as the full support given by the hospital's administration, medical community and ancillary staff.\r\nGeneral Dentistry residents have ample opportunities to pursue a broad spectrum of patient care experiences as well as areas of personal interest.\u00a0 Our medical staff enjoys interacting with the dental residents and has made possible tours through Obstetrics/Gynecology, Orthopedic

Instruction and clinical expertise is provided in all areas of general dentistry with emphasis on implant, prosthodontic and aesthetic cases.\u00a0 The clinical component is supported by laboratory technicians, providing state-of-the-art patient care.\u00a0 Residents work with dedicated hygienists, dental assistants, and clerks, stimulating a dental group private practice.\u00a0 The program is designed to ensure that the residents will be capable of anticipating, diagnosing, planning and treating all phases of dentistry.\u00a0 Service rotations to Stony Brook University Hospital's departments of primary medicine, emergency, operating room and anesthesiology are designed to provide the resident with the skills to manage the needs of the more medically acute and complex patient.http://dentistry.stonybrookmedicine.edu/dentalprograms/gpr \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

Today, we see 75,000 visits annually in our Pediatric/Adult Emergency Departments, deliver 2,000 babies, offer outpatient services to thousands at our network of community ambulatory care centers and present extensive community health education and screening programs.\r\nThe Department of Dental Medicine offers a full spectrum of dental services including: Preventive, Restorative, Fixed/Removeable Prosthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, Periodontics, Endodontics, Oral Surgery, Implantology, Special Care Dentistry and Dental Anesthesiology.\r\nOur General Practice Residency Program is designed to provide training beyond the pre-doctoral (dental school) level. Our education is based on the concept that oral health is an integral and interactive part of total health. The program will expand the scope and depth of the residents' knowledge and clinical skills which will enable them to provide comprehensive oral health care to a wide range of population groups.\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

predoctoral education\r\nTo develop a dentist who will be socially conscious, ethical, compassionate and a respected professional in the community\r\nTo evaluate, diagnosis, manage and treat ambulatory, non-ambulatory and medically compromised patients through a multidisciplinary oral health care approach.\r\nTo function effectively within the hospital and other health care environments.\r\nTo continually strive to expand their dental knowledge base by critically reviewing literature thereby improving their clinical skills.\r\n\r\nNorthport GPR Program Specific Goals:\r\n\r\n\u00a0Provide an excellent and extensive clinical experience in preparation for general practice.\r\n\u00a0To prepare dentists who, either by treating or referring, are competent and confident in diagnosis and treatment in the various disciplines that are components of contemporary general dentistry. This includes the ability to assess the patient\u2019s systemic health and its relation to their oral health care.\r\n\u00a0Provide exposure to and familiarization with the various dental specialties, thus possibly stimulating those who may want to further their education by specializing.\u00a0 Presently this program has representative clinical specialists in oral and maxillofacial surgery, periodontics, and oral and maxillofacial pathology.\r\n\u00a0To prepare dentists who have the ability to interact with all health professionals to provide patients with coordinated oral health care.\r\n\u00a0Provide an introduction to and experience in geriatric dentistry, dentistry for the disabled patient, and dentistry for psychiatric patients.\r\n\u00a0Provide understanding of and experience in treatment of the medically compromised patient.\r\n\u00a0Impart knowledge of various medical disciplines and hospital protocols\r\n\u00a0Develop a dentist who will be a socially conscious, ethical, compassionate and a respected professional in the community.\u00a0 This includes the dentist\u2019s ability to promote oral health care within the community, therefore improving the patient\u2019s quality of life regardless of age, health status or financial resources.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0Develop in the new dentist an attitude of continued lifelong learning so that the GPR graduate will seek opportunities to further his or her knowledge and skills involving general practice following completion of the residency.\r\n\u00a0Graduate a dentist who has the interest and ability to master and apply new technology and changing concepts of patient treatment and practice management.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nAt Northport, the dental residents spend approximately 70% of their time in the dental clinic providing comprehensive and emergency dental care.\u00a0 The remainder of the residents\u2019 time is spent on various rotations such as oral surgery, the emergency room, anesthesiology, dentistry for developmentally disabled children and young adults, preadmission testing, and physical diagnosis.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAll of the clinical and laboratory services found in a general hospital are available for patient care and education, each under the direction of a qualified specialist.\u00a0 A wealth of clinical materials, presenting a wide variety of oral and dental diseases and medical conditions are available at this Medical Center and the affiliated hospital. Patients eligible for comprehensive care at the VA receive the full spectrum of care without any financial obligation on the part of the patient.\u00a0 Outpatient care constitutes the bulk of clinical experience, with inpatient care scheduled on an as-needed basis.\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

That commitment has involved the training of hundreds of young professionals through the General Practice Residency (\u201cGPR\u201d) program at The MetroHealth\u00a0System which started in 1959.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe GPR program\u00a0is accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation for one year and an optional second year.\u00a0 Residents selected to the first year will receive a contract for the first year. Residents completing the first year satisfactorily will be eligible to apply for a position in the second year. Selection for second year will be based on their performance and evaluations.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe GPR program is designed to provide advanced clinical education in general dentistry in a large, modern hospital, as well as community clinic settings.\u00a0The program includes clinical and didactic training under the supervision and evaluation of MetroHealth attendings.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCLINICAL: The clinical phase of the program comprises the bulk of the curriculum.\u00a0 It includes assignments in the general dental practice at MetroHealth\u2019s main campus with 14 operatories, as well as community-based clinics 2-8 operatories. The clinical training during the first year includes rotations through anesthesiology, the emergency department, pre-surgical evaluation.\u00a0 Additional second-year options are provided.\u00a0 Second year residents by virtue of their extensive clinical experience during the first year, rise to the level of an advanced trainee seeking and performing more complicated cases with a higher level of autonomy. The clinical rotations of second year residents include Oral surgery, Pediatric dentistry, and ENT. In addition, the Operating Room schedule allows residents of both years to treat patients under general anesthesia on monthly basis. The on call assignments expose the residents to a great experience while dealing with urgent and trauma cases.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDIDACTIC: The program\u2019s didactic activities support the clinical training and emphasize patient management and treatment planning.\u00a0 The didactic sessions include an emphasis on Hospital Dentistry and Treatment Planning Seminars, in addition to Literature Reviews, Journal club presentations, Conservative Dentistry, Endodontics, Fixed Prosthodontics, Removable Prosthodontics, Periodontics, Medically Compromised Dentistry, Implantology, Practice Management topics and Coding, and Dental Ethics lectures. Interdisciplinary resident presentations allow for residents in both years to learn from each other and get on-their-feet experience in presenting cases and public speaking. Residents also may access continuing education courses and national conferences. The didactic sessions for second year include more advanced topics than in the first year, especially Occlusion, TMJ problems, Implants, and dealing with RCT complications and Redo.\r\nAt the completion of the program, residents are well-trained hospital dentists. They have a command of general dentistry and are confident of their abilities while recognizing their skill set. The program provides them with a solid basis for future professional development in general dentistry or further specialty training.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGPR Program at MetroHealth Medical Center is a stipend program.

{"title": "Dental, General Practice - Einstein Health", "body": "Einstein Healthcare Network's Maxwell S. Fogel Department of Dental Medicine offers the regions largest and most comprehensive hospital-based dental education program. In a challenging clinical and academic environment, postdoctoral programs in General Practice; Endodontics and Orthodontics prepare residents for leadership as clinicians and mentors.\nThe General Practice Residency Program offers a one-year program with an optional second. The optional second year meets the needs of residents who would like to pursue additional experience in implant placement/restoration and more complex restorative treatment cares. (Academic Year = 52 weeks = 2080 clock hours).\nThe Maxwell S. Fogel Department of Dental Medicine shares equal status with Einstein Healthcare Network's other clinical departments. More than 40 faculty members, including specialists in every field of dental medicine, guide residents in clinical, didactic and research areas. The favorable faculty-resident ratio allows for an enhanced learning experience through personal guidance.\nThe department's longstanding academic associations with the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine and Temple University School of Dentistry broaden and enrich the residents' educational experiences. Dental students from the University of Pennsylvania complete rotations at Einstein Healthcare Network and the three institutions freely share information and resources.\nGraduates of our programs are rewarded with abundant career opportunities.\u00a0\nFrom one resident and a single operatory in 1926, the department has expanded to 20 residents and 21 operatories in a modern 8,000 square-foot facility in the medical center's outpatient area. Einstein Healthcare Network's emergency department has an ever growing populace of patients requiring our unique skills, offering dental residents the opportunity to care for dental emergencies in the emergency unit.\nIn addition, dental residents provide dental treatment for patients under general anesthesia in the Medical Center's major operating suite\nIn the clinical area, the department's Implantology Program, which employs several contemporary systems, reflects Einstein's Commitment to innovation in dental medicine. This was the first hospital-based outpatient program of its kind in Philadelphia.\nMost recently, major clinical renovations occurred including placement of new dental delivery systems in all 3 programs areas. Also, all dental imaging systems were converted to digital technology including the placement of a 3D Cone Beam unit utilized by the 3 residency programs. Residents present table clinics, poster displays and research papers at regional and national meetings.\nMajor endowments add to the level of academic and clinical excellence at Einstein Healthcare Network.

The graduate dentist will be trained in all aspects of dentistry and have exposure to all of the various specialties. It is the goal of the program to produce a well-rounded generalist, capable of handling many types of patients, complex treatment plans, and the medically compromised patient. Graduating residents will not only obtain a comprehensive experience, but also understand their individual limits, and understand the specialty referral process, and the importance of teamwork and communication.\r\nThere is a comprehensive didacic program, as well as off service rotations to Anesthesia, Emergency Trauma, Medicine, and Oral Pathology. There is a journal club and regular staff meetings. Each resident is on call 1 week at a time, at home.\r\nFor further information please visit: www.abingtonhealth.org \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0 \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

Resident education is an integral component of the mission of Cleveland Clinic and the Section of Dentistry. The GPR is a one year experience in hospital dentistry during which residents treat a diverse patient population with wide ranging dental and medical needs.\r\nWe have developed a well-rounded program that provides varied clinical experiences to hone and expand the skills and knowledge learned during dental school. The clinical program is supported by a robust academic curriculum.\r\nEducational Objectives\r\n\r\nTrain the resident to act as a primary care provider for individuals and groups of patients. This includes providing emergency and multidisciplinary comprehensive oral health care, providing patient focused care that is coordinated by the general practitioner, directing health promotion and disease prevention activities, and using advanced dental treatment modalities.\u00a0\r\nPlan and provide multidisciplinary oral health care for a wide variety of patients including patients with special needs.\r\nOffer experiences to allow the resident to advance his or her clinical skill levels in the areas of patient assessment and diagnosis, treatment planning, dental and medical emergencies, pain control, operative dentistry, periodontal therapy, exodontia, and fixed and removable prosthodontics.\r\nFunction effectively within the interdisciplinary health care teams in the hospital environment.\r\nApply scientific principles to learning and oral health care, including the use of critical thinking, evidence or outcomes-based clinical decision-making and technology-based information retrieval systems.\r\nUtilize the values of professional ethics, lifelong learning, patient centered care, adaptability, and acceptance of cultural diversity in professional practice.\r\nUnderstand the oral health needs of communities and engage in community service.\r\n\r\nCurriculum\r\nThe program curriculum is designed to train residents to provide comprehensive dental care with a multidisciplinary approach. Rotations outside of dentistry make up approximately six weeks of the year:\r\n\r\nAnesthesia (three weeks)\r\nEmergency Medicine (two weeks)\r\nPre-operative history and physical (one week)\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the year is spent in the dental clinic treating patients including well patients for general dental care, medically complex hospital inpatients and outpatients (i.e. cardiac, head and neck cancer, organ transplant), and special needs patients in the operating room. Throughout the year, residents work closely with general dentists and specialists. In addition, time during the year is specifically dedicated to rotations and observations in:\r\n\r\nOral surgery\r\nPeriodontics\r\nEndodontics\r\nMaxillofacial Prosthodontics\r\nTemporomandibular Joint Disorders\r\nSleep Dentistry\r\n\r\nThe didactic portion of the program includes lectures, journal clubs, literature reviews, and case presentations. Each resident develops and to presents a table clinic to the Section of Dentistry and local Grand Rounds in the spring.\r\nOn-Call\r\nResidents provide on-call service to the hospital during night and weekend hours on a rotating basis which is determined by the residents at the beginning of each year. Call can be taken from home provided the resident can reach the hospital within 30 minutes.\r\nTraining at Cleveland Clinic\r\nFor more information about training at the Cleveland Clinic, please visit Graduate Medical Education at\u00a0https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/graduate-medical-education\r\nMain Campus Tour\r\nPlease use the link below for a tour of our Main Campus:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LrQ8V6offk \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

It is a comprehensive hospital general dentistry program, providing training at a level beyond that accomplished in pre-doctoral training. During the one year program, residents will be trained in preventive dentistry, operative dentistry, the placement and restoration of implants, complex fixed and removable prosthodontics, periodontics, endodontics, oral surgery, IV sedation, operating room cases, and management of medically complex patients. Off-service assignments include rotations to the general medicine and anesthesiology. These rotations offer the residents opportunity to enhance their knowledge of the relationship between the oral and systemic problems and to broaden their clinical experience in the management of patients with medical and psychiatric conditions.

ADA Dental Residency Program Requirements In general, current dental school graduates demonstrate only a rudimentary understanding of data collection, differential diagnosis and treatment planning. When coexisting medical morbidities complicate the patient care scenario, it becomes necessary for the dentist to engage the physician in rendering the safest and most efficacious dental care in the most appropriate setting. There is a need for these dental graduates to develop and foster this understanding of the implications of dental care relative to the other disciplines of health care and vice versa.\r\nThe GPR program prepares residents to manage total oral health by providing instruction and experience in the delivery of dental care to a wide range of ambulatory and hospitalized patients.\r\nA Resident's View of the St. Elizabeth Program\r\nA full compliment of teaching staff including general dentists, oral maxillofacial surgeons, periodontists, pedodontists, orthodontists and endodontists participate in the teaching program.

An approved second year training experience also exists.\r\nFIRST YEAR PROGRAM:\r\nThe program is designed to serve as a post-graduate educational experience for dentists, providing them the opportunity to deliver comprehensive dental care on both an outpatient and inpatient basis in the hospital environment. The program also provides extramural experiences on two mobile dental vans at Youngstown State University School of Dental Hygiene at Choffin Career Technical Center School of Dental Assisting at the Pittsburgh Academy of Implantology.\r\nIn general, current dental school graduates demonstrate only a rudimentary understanding of data collection, differential diagnosis and treatment planning. When coexisting medical morbidities complicate the patient care scenario, it becomes necessary for the dentist to consult with the physician in determining the safest and most efficacious dental venue of care.There is a need for these dental graduates to develop and foster this understanding of the implications of dental care relative to the other disciplines of health care and vice versa. The April 8, 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, \"Advancing Oral Health in America,\" identifies the maintenance of oral health as a public health priority and includes 7 recommendations for implementing this medical-dental linkage.\r\nThe GPR program prepares residents to manage total oral health by providing instruction and experience in the delivery of dental care to a wide range of ambulatory and hospitalized patients.\r\n\u00a0A full compliment of teaching staff including general dentists, oral maxillofacial surgeons, periodontists, pedodontists, orthodontists and endodontists participate in the teaching program.\r\n\u00a0The Program includes: lectures, demonstrations, and direct experience in hospital protocol and practice, physical diagnosis, pain control, dental management of the compromised patient, and emergency care. The one month rotation in Anesthesia provides an emphasis on the use of inhalation and intravenous sedation for the ambulatory patients. Lectures, seminars, conferences, assigned case presentations and audiovisual presentations constitute the didactic portions of the program.

It is a one-year certificate program designed to develop essential clinical skills, attitudes, judgement and abilities related to the comprehensive practice of dentistry. The program also is structured to provide training in the management of medically, physically and mentally compromised patients in a hospital environment. In addition to training in general dentistry, the resident will participate in rotations in anesthesia and emergency medicine.\r\nDentists entering this program can expect to receive advanced training in... *Diagnosis and treatment planning *Fixed and removable prosthodontics *Implant dentistry *Restorative dentistry *Endodontics *Periodontics *Conscious sedation *Oral and maxillofacial surgery *Pediatric dentistry\r\nThe residency is clinically oriented with much time devoted to areas of training where limited experience is available in dental school. About 85 percent of the resident's time is spent providing dental care. The remaining time is devoted to medical rotations and various nonclinical didactic experiences. Patient treatment is provided at Prisma Health, Dorn Veterans Administration Hospital, Richland/Lexington County Adult/Children's Dental Clinics and the Columbia Oral Health Clinic. Each of these clinical settings is unique and has a specific emphasis that helps provide the resident with a well-rounded experience. The majority of clinical training occurs at the Prisma Health Richland campus. \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

It provides the resident with an advanced educational and clinical opportunity building on the knowledge and skills attained in dental school. Comprehensive dental care, in the context of each patient's total health care needs, is a major focus of the program. The program develops the residents\u2019 ability to interact with other health care professionals throughout the hospital. It will foster the pursuit of individual areas of interest and enhance the achievement of career and professional goals.\r\nThe goals of the GPR at New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, Division of Dental Medicine include:\r\nI-Resident Education\r\nTo develop competency in general dentistry through a balanced didactic and clinical program with emphasis on oral diagnosis, treatment planning, and multidisciplinary comprehensive care. Residents are prepared to deliver high quality dental and surgical care as a member of the hospital team and to differentiate treatment responsibility for the in-patient, the ambulatory patient, and the emergency patient. It is expected that the resident will become competent in all aspects of general dentistry and be able to perform specialty procedures and multi-disciplinary care within the parameters of general practice.\r\nThe resident will also be encouraged to understand what it means to be a life-long learner. The didactic elements within the program will require resident participation including literature reviews, poster presentations, treatment planning and case presentation conferences. The challenges of assimilating an ever increasing amount of knowledge will be tackled on an ongoing basis.\r\nII-Patient Care\r\nTo provide a collaborative approach in patient treatment planning and management. Patient care is planned, provided, monitored, and modified as necessary with emphasis on multi-disciplinary care. The program will prepare the dental resident to evaluate, diagnose, and implement oral health care for patients who present with medical risks as well as patients who present with oral facial trauma, infection and pain. It is expected that the resident will be able to communicate and educate their medical colleagues on the needs of their patients so dental care can be provided without medical complications. Graduates of the program are expected to manage comprehensive dental care as the leader of a team of dental specialists and physicians.\r\nIII-Community Service\r\nTo deliver dental services to underserved populations, to involve residents in outreach programs, and to educate and motivate the importance of oral health on a global level. The resident should develop a greater understanding of the diverse needs of the local community and be motivated to provide care to all members of the global community on an ongoing basis.\r\nMore than 70% of the dental resident's time is devoted to direct delivery of oral health care, including routine and complex \u00a0procedures. There is advanced training in: treatment planning, periodontics, pediatric dentistry, operative dentistry, orthodontics, fixed and removable prosthodontics, endodontics, oral surgery, implant dentistry, and oral medicine.\r\nOral healthcare is provided to patients of all ages and ranges from immediate emergency care through complex, multidisciplinary, treatment. The residents have the opportunity to work with well-respected general practitioners as well as board certified specialists. Patient care is always under the guidance of the attending staff. There is no oral surgery residency at this hospital allowing the general practice resident to gain considerable experience providing oral surgery procedures within the scope of their ability, both in the clinic and the operating room, under the guidance of our team of oral surgeons.\r\nThe resident is required to fulfill obligations to medical rotations in anesthesia, medicine, radiation oncology, surgery, and the emergency department. Interactions with other departments in the hospital builds the residents confidence and enhances the hospital experience. These features of\u00a0New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital enrich the opportunity for dental residents to interact with other hospital house staff.\u00a0\r\nThe Division of Dental Medicine is managed with a confirmed appointment schedule. Clinical assignments have been updated to deal with the ongoing challenges providing dental care since the onset of COVID. The clinic operates Monday through Saturday. Clinic hours on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday are 8AM until 9PM. On Wednesday, Friday and Saturday clinic hours are 8AM until 4PM. Assignment are made on a weekly basis. Weekly clinic assignments are either Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday ,Thursday, Saturday. Rotations to other services run on various schedules determined by the service. The resident will spend 41 weeks involved in clinical practice, teledentistry, practice management, operating room services and hospital consultations. There are 7 weeks of medical specialty rotations, and 4 weeks of vacation to complete the year. Residents are expected to be on call once weekly in July and two to three times monthly for the remainder of the year.\r\nDidactics are scheduled on a weekly basis and include live presentations by guest speakers, faculty and residents. There are also weekly distance learning assignments on advanced dental topics and include video presentations with selected reading assignments. The curriculum is built to enhance learning and correlate basic knowledge with advanced concepts.\r\nThe program also has an optional second year available.

The abstract must be submitted by April 1 of the year prior to completion of the program and the paper completed by the middle of the final year of the program. The abstract and paper may be a report of cases with literature review, a description of a new technique, an essay dealing with any significant aspect of oral and maxillofacial surgery, a report based on a research project, or any other topic approved by the faculty.\nBecause of the necessary deadlines, it is essential that each resident choose a topic during the second year. The subject of the paper should be discussed with the assigned faculty advisor. The project does not need to be performed with the assigned advisor; it can be done under the supervision of others among the faculty and attending surgeons community-wide; however, it is the resident\u2019s responsibility to keep the assigned advisor informed of progress on the paper.\nThe project must progress to the point that by April 1 prior to the year of program completion an abstract can be prepared and submitted for presentation at the Annual AAOMS meeting; attendance at the meeting is contingent upon the submission of an abstract. The final manuscript for submission for publication will be completed by January 30 of the final year.\nThere are two main opportunities for research projects. First, residents may participate in ongoing faculty research projects. Second, the resident with a strong interest in a specific project will be encouraged to design such a project and will receive faculty support of his/her clinical or laboratory experimental endeavors.\n*Obtaining a badge from UConn Health is mandatory and required in order to be enrolled. This process includes a full background check. Badges are subject to approval from UConn Police and the Risk Management Office.\u00a0\nThe vast majority of the thirty-six oral and maxillofacial surgery faculty are Diplomates of the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

The program is\u00a0ONLY\u00a0open to graduates of CODA-accredited US and Canadian dental schools accredited by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association. The admission criteria for the 6-year track is similar to the 4-year CAGS program with the exception being that all applicants must also have a US or Canadian undergraduate college degree. The MD-integrated track includes sponsorship for USMLE examinations. The requirements for medical licensure differ from state to state. Applicants are encouraged to review each state\u2019s requirement for medical licensure. The\u00a0Federation of State Medical Boards\u00a0(http://www.fsmb.org/) has a complete listing of medical boards within the continental United States. Completion of the OMFS-MD program does not guarantee licensure in any state. All applicants\u00a0MUST\u00a0forward official results from the National Dental Boards Part I to the postdoctoral admissions office as part of their application. \u00a0It is\u00a0required\u00a0that applicants also forward scores from the AAOMS-sponsored National Board of Medical Examiners\u00ae (NBME\u00ae) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) as part of their application. Selection into the program is extremely competitive and preference is given to applicants with high academic achievement and an aptitude for oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nThe program is designed to provide the resident with sufficient didactic and clinical education to meet the requirements of the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and to become a proficient practitioner. All residents are extremely well prepared for careers in clinical practice, both in academic and private practice settings. Residents are encouraged to develop skills in teaching and clinical research in preparation for an academic career.\nGraduates of non-US or -Canadian accredited schools are\u00a0NOT eligible to apply for the 6-year OMFS-MD residency program. They may apply for the one-year\u00a0Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Internship program.\nGoals\nNationally, there has been a long-standing trend for US OMFS residency programs to offer a concurrent MD degree through an affiliated medical school. The addition of the MD component to traditional OMFS programs provides select residents additional education, training and credentials commensurate with the expanding range and complexity of their surgical repertoire.\nThe goals of both the 4-year and 6-year oral and maxillofacial surgery residency programs are to provide residents with excellent didactic and clinical experience. On completion of either program, graduates will possess sufficient professional knowledge, skills, and ability to practice competently and independently. Residents are extremely well-prepared to meet the requirement of the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\u00a0\nCurriculum and Rotations\n\nClick image to enlarge.\nIn the 6-year track, matriculated residents spend the first month on the OMFS service along with the 4-year track PGY-1 residents. This time is spent being oriented to the hospital, to resident life, and a significant amount of time is devoted to gaining an introduction to clinical medicine (learning to take a history and perform full body physical examination). At the end of this month, the 6-year track residents enter in to the 2nd year of medical school (advanced standing). They spend the remainder of this year and the next year fully integrated in the medical school (Years 1 and 2 of the program). The two full years in medical school are at the level of 2nd year (aimed to augment basic and clinical science didactic knowledge and physical diagnosis skills) and 3rd year (required clinical rotations required for MD-degree). The third year of the MD-integrated program is a \u201chybrid year\u201d; enrolled residents complete 4 months of medical rotations (required for the MD degree), spend 4 months on anesthesia which is followed by 8 months on the OMFS service. In May of this third year, the resident will have completed requirements of the MD-degree. The 4th year of the program fulfills the requirements of general surgery and the remaining anesthesia requirements besides providing additional time on the OMFS service as a junior resident During the 5th and 6th years of training, residents are fully on the OMFS service (24 months on-service) concurrent with the final 2 years of the 4-year track residents. This gives a total of 33 months on the OMFS service in the 6-year track (1 in the 1st year, 4 in the 3rd year, 4 in the 4th year, 24 in the 5th and 6th years) compared to 34 months in the 4-year track (10 in 1st year, 24 months in 3rd and 4th year) assuring a comparable experience.\nOral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery Training Curriculum\nBesides the medical school curriculum, residents in the 6-year MD integrated program will participate in all didactic activities and education of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery department. This includes the following specific courses and seminars which they will receive during their on-service (OMFS) ROTATIONS:\nYear 1:\nYEARS 3, 4, 5, AND 6:\nCourses\nAn ongoing review of the classic and current literature in oral and maxillofacial surgery and related disciplines.

Interns enrolled in the program will rotate through Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine, Boston Medical Center, and other affiliate institutions, and their clinical responsibilities are similar to the categorical PGY1 residents enrolled in the OMS residency program.\n\u00a0\nGoals\nTo provide trainees a live experience of hospital-based resident training and an in-depth understanding of the PGY 1 level expectations. On completion, graduates should possess sufficient professional knowledge, skills, and ability to practice minor oral surgery competently and independently. They will also become familiar with contemporary hospital-based, academic OMS practice and the daily life of an OMS resident. The intent of this program is also to strengthen the interns subsequent application for a formal OMS residency training program by providing a diverse clinical experience and adequate opportunity for relevant research.\n\u00a0\nAnnual Openings\nOral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery Pre-Residency Internship Program: maximum of two openings\n\u00a0\nTuition\nBoston University Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine charges tuition to all interns entering the preliminary internship program.

The BMC House Officers Association prepares information about the neighborhood and transportation most accessible to the core hospitals, and maintains a list of apartments and houses that will be vacated by current house officers in June. This list is available to new residents in late April. In addition, BUMC\u2019s Off-Campus Services Office provides valuable information on housing.\nStipend\nAnnual stipends are available for interns accepted into the program. This stipend is equivalent to the stipend offered to categorical OMS PGY1 residents by the graduate medical education department.\nApplication Information\nVisit the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine postdoctoral admissions website for application instructions.\nThe Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Pre-Residency Internship Program uses the ADEA Post-doctoral Application Support Service (PASS) for admissions.

We accept 5 residents each year for a total of 20 residents. \u00a0We have a rigorous program. Our faculty has high expectations with your overall performance and achievement in clinical expertise and academic excellence. Our residents routinely score in the 90th percentile on the annual nationwide in-service examination taken by all OMFS residents. Our graduates take and pass the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery exams on a regular basis.\nIn addition to working our various sites at Montefiore, as an oral surgery resident you will work within our two affiliates, St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx and Jersey City Medical Center, both Level II trauma centers. \u00a0Rotating through these different hospitals as a second, third and fourth-year resident exposes you to different learning environments with different surgical faculty.\nIf you are selected for the residency program at Montefiore, you will be busy. Within our main campus, we have 3 outpatient centers that serve the population of the Bronx. \u00a0We have an operating room and admitting privileges at five hospitals, Montefiore Hospital, Wakefield Hospital, Weiler Hospital, St. Barnabas Hospital, and Jersey City Medical Center.\u00a0 In 2018, the Montefiore OMFS division alone had over 35,000 outpatient visits, over 350 operating room cases, over 4500 cases of intravenous sedation and placement of over 3500 dental implants.\nAt Montefiore, you work closely with faculty and your co-residents. \u00a0Within our department, we have daily interaction with our general practice, prosthodontics, pediatric and orthodontic programs. \u00a0Within the hospital, we have a close working relationship with the ENT, Plastics and Head and Neck surgical subspecialties. Since Montefiore has no undergraduate dental students, our five full-time faculty members devote their time exclusively to the graduate residents. Intra-specialty cooperation is the norm at Montefiore.\nThe program has high standards for academic achievement and learning. In addition to a program of hospital rounds, weekly conferences, formal courses in physical diagnosis and oral pathology, you are sponsored by the department to complete a comprehensive OMFS board review course in your final year. \u00a0Residents are expected to embark on an extensive program of reading and study to include trauma, reconstruction, orthognathic and implant rehabilitation with a focus on ABOMS preparation. Weekly conferences and day-to-day interactions with the faculty allow the residents to apply their knowledge and expertise to real-world treatment. Formal lectures comprise a portion of the didactic program, but by far the majority of the teaching is done via the Socratic approach. Faculty members will be there, standing beside you in the clinic or operating room, asking questions, not in their offices preparing lectures or doing research. \u00a0In addition to the didactic program, cadaveric surgical anatomy course and orthognathic surgery courses are given each year. ACLS, ATLS, PALS courses are required to be completed during your four years.\nCall Schedule\nThe OMFS chief resident is responsible for developing the call schedule, where you will be assigned on-call on average every third night. Effective this past year, residents on overnight in-house call at Montefiore will have the following day off. \u00a0When you rotate through the Anesthesia, Medicine and General Surgery services your on-call will be the same as their respective resident staff. In-house on-call is expected throughout your first two years of our program and may be required during any time during your four years.\nYou will treat a diverse population of different ages, expectations, and cultures\nYou will have hands-on experience and real expertise in the full scope of oral and maxillofacial surgery.\nYou will have extensive experience in intravenous outpatient sedation and anesthesia.\nYou will have placed more dental implants than residents from any other program in the nation.\nYou will work with all sub-specialties.\nIn the operating room, you will do the cases, not just watch and hold retractors.\nThe Program Year by Year\nThe first few months of your first year will be devoted to ensuring that you have the basic skills necessary to perform out-patient procedures, handle on-call responsibilities and be prepared for off-service rotations. \u00a0You will participate in all resident functions for that service and will be evaluated by the faculty and staff of that service.\n5 months - OMFS\n3 months - Anesthesia\n2 months - Internal Medicine\n2 months - General Surgery\nPGY-2\nThe second year of the residency program, 3 months will be dedicated to off-service rotations. The remainder of the year you will be on the oral surgery service working in outpatient dental clinics and participating in the operating room.

{"title": "Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery & Dentistry | Patient Care", "body": "For a complete description of our services, please visit our web site: Weill Cornell Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery\nWith nine full time faculty members and some 40 voluntary faculty, the Division of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is a major academic-based program providing care that ranges from general dentistry to advanced surgical restorative and reconstructive procedures. We also offer a dedicated children's dentistry facility staffed by Pediatric Dentists, one of only a few in the New York region.\nWe have recently completed a major renovation that has resulted in an expanded, state-of-the-art, 4,000 square foot facility that can better serve our patients, provide a more comfortable environment and enhance our residency education and training experience.\nFrom routine dental care on teeth and gums to innovative arthroscopic surgery on jaw joints and major reconstructive facial surgery, our specific areas of expertise include: General Dentistry, preventive, restorative and cosmetic;implant dentistry; root canal procedures; periodontics-surgical and non surgical; complex prosthodontics; pediatric dentistry; oral and maxillofacial medicine and pathology;dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia; non surgical care of temporomandibular joint disorders; orthodontics; diagnosis and management of acute, chronic and atypical head, neck, facial and oral pain syndromes; surgical management of temporomandibular joint derangements, including Botox; surgical management of benign diseases of the mouth and jaw; surgical management for congenital and growth deformities and management of facial trauma; treatment device for sleep apnea.\u00a0\n\"He\u2019s amazing ! I am so happy with my results post double jaw surgery. He is very professional and precise. He made my experience very easy . I made the best decision using him as my surgeon.\"\n\"DR GWENDOLYN REEVE WAS VERY HELPFUL, CONSIDERATE, UNDERSTANDING, VERY PATIENT &amp; GIVING TO ME. SHE IS VERY\nCOMPASSIONATE, HONEST &amp; VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE, VERY SKILLFUL IN HER MEDICAL SPECIALTY. SHE GOES OUT OF HER WAY TO HELP HER PATIENTS LIKE ME TO GIVE THE BEST POSSIBLE LABORATORY TESTS &amp; TREATMENTS TO BRING HER PATIENTS BACK TO EXCELLENT HEALTH.\nDR G. REEVE IS VERY ACCOMMODATING &amp; VERY KIND &amp; SHE MAKES HER PATIENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE &amp; AT EASE SO THAT HER PATIENTS ARE STRENGTHENED INSPITE OF PATIENTS' WEAKNESS &amp; NERVOUSNESS. DR G REEVE IS AN INSPIRATION TO ME &amp; GIVES ME A FEELING OF SECURITY &amp; HOPE. I THANK GOD ALMIGHTY FOR HAVING DR GWENDOLYN REEVE AS MY DOCTOR SURGEON WHO IS AN EXPERT IN HER PROFESSION WITH A VERY GOOD HEART TOWARDS HER PATIENTS LIKE ME.\nMAY GOD BLESS &amp; REWARD HER ABUNDANTLY FOR SHARING HER EXCELLENT PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL SKILL WITH COMPASSION &amp; KINDNESS TOWARDS HER PATIENTS. AMEN.\"\n\"I cannot recommend Dr. Reeve and her entire office enough. I saw Dr. Reeve at the suggestion of my dentist to fix my bite. Having someone operate on your face is daunting at best, but I couldn\u2019t of asked for a better experience with both her as a doctor and her support staff.\nTo start, I never felt rushed or pressured when talking to Dr. Reeve about if surgery was the best option and what it would entail. She gave me all the information I wanted and more, so I could make the most informed decision about moving forward with surgery.\nIn a pre-op appointment she answered over 30 questions I had about surgery and recovery. Despite what I assume is an insanely busy schedule, she encouraged me to keep asking questions knowing that this was a huge deal to me.\nPost-op she was incredibly prompt whenever any issue came up, she made sure I knew I could reach out even for a minor issue. Truly her patient communication is above and beyond. Dr. Reeve personally called both my dad and my roommate after surgery before I was awake to let them know it went well.\nThe office staff is great. Anytime my insurance denied something the office would automatically appeal it so I didn\u2019t have to argue with insurance while recovering. I would like to personally recommend her office coordinator Evelyn and her residents including Dr. Tapan who were a huge help through the entire process.\nMy face looks amazing. Every other dentist and doctor that has seen my mouth since has commented on what an incredible job my surgeon did. I am so glad I did surgery with Dr. Reeve. I truly cannot imagine a surgeon that could do a better job.\""},

Implicit in this mission is a commitment to educate residents and provide an outstanding clinical experience. The Department of Dental Medicine and Oral Surgery also renders routine and emergency oral health care to the community, and supports the patient population within the hospital.\nThe curriculum in both of our fully-accredited residency programs reflects the core values of the profession in private and public health care settings. It creates a humanistic, educational environment that facilitates the development of responsible and ethical health professionals who provide excellent oral health care, while meeting the special needs of our patients. Our faculty provides educational and clinical instruction in all dental disciplines. The programs strive to produce graduates who will advance the professional practice of General Dentistry and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, and while improving oral health, as well as overall health, through clinical care and scholarly activities. Graduates will have the skills of self-assessment and scientific methodology that ensure lifelong learning.\nWe appreciate your interest and look forward to hearing from you.\n\u00a0\nVictor Nannini, DDS\nProgram Director, Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery\nEileen Chun, DDS, MSEd\nChair, Department of Dental Medicine and Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery\u00a0\nProgram Director, General Practice Dentistry\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Medical Center offers a four-\u00adyear, single-\u00addegree, fully-accredited curriculum with comprehensive training in the specialty of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The pro\u00adgram, which accommodates one resident each year, offers sequential training in the full scope of Oral and Maxillofacial procedures. Some areas of excellence associated with the training program are:\nAll members of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery house staff participate in various conferences and meetings when on service. Each year, an Oral and Maxillofacial Sur\u00adgery In-Service Training Examination (OMSITE) is administered to each of the residents in order to assist both the residents and the program in assessing their respective strengths and weaknesses. At least one published paper or abstract is a requirement of individ\u00adual members of the house staff, and we provide the opportunity to engage in a clini\u00adcal research project, which we strongly encourage. Upon the successful completion of the program, the resident will be certified as Board-eligible in the specialty of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs you begin your training as a first year resident, you will be clinically responsible for learning outpatient, inpatient, and o\u00ad\u00adperating room protocols. Additionally, your academic focus will be on learning the basic skills necessary to attain proficiency in outpatient care and on-call responsibilities by observing and performing both outpatient and operating room procedures. You will participate in all conferences, lectures, staff meetings, and finish the year with your first off-service rotation in anesthesiology that will continue into the start of your second year. Your first year didactic program will consist of a comprehensive course in Physical Diagnosis (sponsored by the Department of Medicine and the Stony Brook Medical School).\nAs a second year resident, you spend your first 7 months off service completing rotations in anesthesiology and medicine. When rotating through the Department of Anesthesiology, you will administer various anesthetics to surgical patients on a daily basis, intubate patients, acquire skills in medical risk assessment, and gain knowledge in the principles of general anesthesia (including physiology, anatomy, and pharmacology). During your two-month rotation through the Department of Medicine, your scope will include diagnostic and therapeutic modalities administered to patients with multi-systems failure who are in need of acute and intensive medical care. When you are back on service, you will apply your knowledge and skills more independently via administration of pre-, intra-, and post-operative care as well as beginning to provide intravenous outpatient sedation.\nAs a third year resident, you assume increased responsibilities and conduct intravenous outpatient sedation cases in the OMFS clinic. In the second half of this year, you will complete rotations in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Department of Trauma, and Department of Surgery. In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit your education will be directed towards the acute diagnostic and therapeutic care rendered to the traumatized and critically injured patient. When rotating through the Trauma Department, your focus will be on evaluating, treating, and managing patients in the emergent setting with a wide variety of traumatic injuries. During the rotation in the Department of Surgery, you will obtain skills in the care and management of the multiple-trauma patient, emergency room triage, management and care of the head and neck patient, as well as other multidisciplinary approaches to patient care.\nIn your chief year, you will take on major responsibilities such as supervising and coordinating a large portion of the clinical and didactic activities. The chief resident will spend the year honing his/her skills by performing major oral and maxillofacial procedures across a broad scope while taking on the leadership responsibilities of disseminating knowledge to other residents via conferences, rounds, and structured didactic programs. As the chief resident, you will also rotate for a total of two months at the private affiliate hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center and participate in procedures at NYU Winthrop University Hospital in order to broaden elective case exposures.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVictor Nannini, DDS \u2013 full-time\n\u00a0\nOren Richman, DDS, MD \u2013 full-time\n\u00a0\nRory Sadoff, DDS\n\u00a0\nClaudine Cafferata, DDS\n\u00a0\nCraig Levine, DDS\n\u00a0\nGreg Panossian, DDS\n\u00a0\nMarieange Panossian, DDS, MD\n\u00a0\nKenneth Paticoff, DDS\n\u00a0\nMichael Schwartz, DDS\n\u00a0\nBrian Wolf, DMD\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nChief\u00a0| Cody Mumma, DDS\n\u00a0\n\nPGY-3 | Jonathan Morcos, DDS\n\u00a0\nPGY-2 | Jessica Li, DDS\n\u00a0\n\nPGY-1 | Joshua Lilly, DDS\n\u00a0\nJessica Carney, on behalf of:\nDr. Victor Nannini\nDirector, Advanced Training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery\nNassau University Medical Center\nBox # 72\n2201 Hempstead Turnpike\nEast Meadow, NY 11554\nTelephone: (516) 572-6895\nTelephone: (516) 572-8774\nFacsimile: (516) 572-5379\nEmail: jcarney@numc.edu\n\u00a0\nWe are offering hands-off observership opportunities at this time.

Under the tutelage of oral and maxillofacial surgery faculty members, our residents also perform trauma surgery, repair of craniofacial anomalies, and treatment of temporomandibular disorders.\nAppointments cancelled with less than 48 business hours' notice are considered\u00a0broken appointments.\nFor consultations, a patient may be dismissed from the care of the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery after two broken appointments. For surgery appointments, a patient may be dismissed from the care of the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery after one broken appointment. Should you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, please contact us as early as possible.\nThe Division accepts new patients on a case by case basis based on the availability of our limited resources. At times, our resident clinic may not be accepting new patients from referral sources outside the College of Dentistry. The resident clinic always accepts patients for surgical services who are current patients of the College of Dentistry (have had a comprehensive or periodic examination within 24 months by a resident or dental student). The Division reserves the right to dictate resident-level or faculty-level care based on these resources and the surgical complexity of the case.\nAs specialists, we require a written referral for all services. We also require a consultation prior to surgery. In all cases, your first appointment with us will\u00a0not\u00a0be for surgical services. This enables our practitioners to meet you, perform an examination, discuss treatment and anesthetic options with you, and present you with a comprehensive treatment plan including an estimate of your financial liability.\nOur financial policies are designed to be an extension of our commitment to provide the best quality care possible for you. Please advise us of any changes that may affect your billing status. Examples include: change in address, telephone number, employer, insurance coverage, etc. This will enable us to provide you with the best possible service.

{"title": "Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) | School of Dental Medicine | Case Western Reserve University", "body": "Oral and maxillofacial surgery is the specialty of dentistry that includes the diagnosis and surgical and related treatment of diseases, injuries, and defects involving both the functional and esthetic aspects of the hard and soft tissues of the head, mouth, teeth, gums, jaws and neck. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are dental specialists who treat conditions, defects, injuries, and esthetic aspects of the mouth, teeth, jaws, and face. The training of our surgical residents includes a four-year graduate degree in dentistry and the completion of a five-year hospital surgical residency program, which includes attending medical school to obtain a medical degree and a year of general surgery training.\nOral and maxillofacial surgeons care for adults and children who experience such conditions as problematic wisdom teeth, facial pain, and misaligned jaws. They treat accident victims suffering facial injuries and fractures, offer reconstructive and dental implant surgery, and care for patients with benign and malignant tumors and cysts of the jaws and functional and esthetic conditions of the maxillofacial areas. With our advanced training in pain control and anesthesia, we are able to provide our services with maximum patient comfort and safety. Our mission is to provide world class surgical services to our patients, while educating and training future surgeons to become highly competent and caring clinicians, and future leaders of our profession. We embrace discovery and scholarship as critical elements in the training of our residents.\nUniversity Hospitals is the primary institution where CWRU Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery residents conduct their daily activities. University Hospitals has been serving the people of northeast Ohio for nearly 150 years. Throughout this time, it has kept its commitment\u00a0\u201cTo Heal. To Teach. To Discover\u201d. Besides the UH Case Medical Center, located within the CWRU campus area, there are numerous UH locations around Cleveland and the surrounding areas where residents practice over the course of their 5 years of training. UH Case Medical Center enjoys some of the most prestigious centers of excellence in the country and the world, including the University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Rainbow Babies &amp; Children\u2019s Hospital, and University Hospitals MacDonald Women\u2019s Hospital.\nThe Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center provides care to over 105,000 veterans each year in northern Ohio. The Wade Park Medical Center has been recognized for more programs of excellence than any other VA medical center in the nation, including Geriatric Evaluation and Management and Advance Platform Technology. CWRU OMFS residents rotate through the VA OMFS clinic during their first and third years of residency when they independently perform all dentoalveolar procedures in both the hospital and clinical settings under the direct supervision of the OMFS attendings.\nMetroHealth is an integrated health system with an acute care hospital housing a Level I Adult Trauma Center. Annually, MetroHealth will handle more than one million patient visits including more than 100,000 in the Emergency Department, making it one of the busiest systems in the country. CWRU residents rotate through the OMFS clinic during their third year of training, where they continue to develop skills in dentoalveolar procedures using outpatient sedation while gaining more experience in the operating room setting. Residents will also be directly involved with management and care of trauma patients in this busy hospital setting.\nDr. Baur is Professor and Chair of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, as well as Chief of Oral and Maxillofacial at University Hospitals/Cleveland Medical Center and Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital.\nDr. Baur is Board Certified by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. His special interests include management of benign and malignant tumors of the head and neck, temporomandibular joint surgery, surgical management of obstructive sleep apnea, and reconstruction of defects of the head and neck."},

Having a diverse patient population, being a Level-1 trauma center, and having a large faculty with varying clinical interests allows the program to provide training consistent with that goal. In addition, all of our clinical facilities are equipped for full-scale general anesthesia including a clinic-based ambulatory operating room.\nMajor inpatient surgical procedures during a recent typical year:\nAt least one-half day per week is designated for the chief resident and third-year residents to see pre-op implant patients, perform implant placement, sinus lift procedures, and soft and hard tissue preprosthetic operations. This dedicated time ensures that each resident can follow their implant patients all the way from consult to surgery to restoration. A faculty member with advanced implant experience supervises this clinic and provides expertise in implants.\nMajor cosmetic surgery is performed in our clinic on a regular basis. The cases are done under local anesthesia, IV sedation or intubated general anesthesia, depending on the length and complexity of the procedure. The entire spectrum of facial cosmetic surgery, including, facelifts, browlifts, eyelid surgery, otoplasty, Botox injections, cosmetic skin resurfacing, and cosmetic augmentation procedures, are done by chief and third-year residents under the supervision of faculty who are credentialed by the State Board to do such procedures. During this clinic session, pre and postoperative patients are also seen in conjunction with the attending surgeon staffing the clinic.\nOne-half day per week is designated for orthognatic surgery evaluations and postoperative care patients. All levels of residents are involved with this clinic. A full-time faculty member who is involved in treating these orthognathic surgery patients supervises the residents.\nOnce a month, an upper level resident and a faculty member see TMJ surgical patients for initial evaluation, re-evaluation and post- operative follow up at the Hospital Clinic. In addition, when an upper level resident is on the intramural Faculty Practice rotation, they gain additional experience in the management of these patients. The residents gain ample skills and learn the techniques to postoperative manage these patients in addition to their operating room surgical experience.\nA separate TMJ clinic exists within the department for the nonsurgical management of TMJ patients. The residents have an optional rotation in these clinics early in their training.\nOn a biweekly basis, all patients treated for facial soft tissue and bone trauma are seen by the residents and a faculty member with an interest and expertise in the management of such cases. Assessment of postoperative complications and the need for additional reconstructive or cosmetic procedures is done during these clinic sessions.\nOne upper level resident (a third year or a chief resident) is assigned to be involved in the care of private practice patients at both the faculty intramural and off-campus private practices. During this rotation, the resident gains a \u201creal world\u201d perspective on ambulatory and hospitalized minor and major oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures and develops the skills of pre- and post-operative patient care and office management skills on a one-on-one basis with private practitioners.\nAll of our residents perform a variety of anesthetic procedures in the OMFS clinic including IV anesthesia, inhalational anesthesia, LMA (Larynseal Mask Anesthetic) and endotracheal intubations.

Special provisions are also available for individuals to pursue a PhD or MS during either track.** Each program prepares practitioners to treat diseases, injuries and defects involving both the functional and aesthetic aspects of the hard and soft tissues of the oral and maxillofacial region. The basic prerequisite for both four- and six-year programs are a DDS or DMD degree from an ADA-accredited dental school. See below for additional requirements for the integrated OMS/MD program. Applicants will be required to submit the Comprehensive Basic Science Exam (CBSE) score offered by the AAOMS.\r\nBoth four- and six-year residency programs are designed to integrate the fields of medicine and dentistry. The residency provides extensive surgical experience and exposure in areas such as oral and maxillofacial pathology, maxillofacial oncology, maxillofacial trauma, reconstruction, cleft palate, orthognathic, dentoalveolar surgery, implants, TMJ and aesthetic surgery as well as outpatient anesthesia.\r\nThe six-year program adopts a similar schedule to the four-year program with the primary difference consisting of requirements for obtaining the MD degree. The first year is spent with the Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery department. In the second, third and fourth years, residents are enrolled in medical school, completing years two, three and four of the medical school curriculum. During the fourth year of medical school, eight months are provided for the fulfillment of requirements related to the oral and maxillofacial surgery residency, such as rotations on neurosurgery and anesthesia. The fifth year of the residency is a surgical internship year, which includes 4 months of general surgery and 8 months of Oral and Maxillofacial surgery. In the sixth year, the resident serves as a chief resident with rotations to\u00a0six different hospitals. Upon satisfactory completion of the six-year program, residents receive a certificate in Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery and a MD degree.\r\nThe six-year OMS/MD candidate must meet the admissions requirements for The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) Medical School. \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

The division's faculty members have dedicated their careers to the orthodontic profession while being supported by excellent and caring clinical and administrative staff and assistants. Our main goal is to provide students with the highest quality education and to be proficient in the clinical specialty of orthodontics. We also provide a program of education in the clinical specialty that satisfies the standards of the Commission on Accreditation of the American Dental Association and the American Board of Orthodontics. The graduate program consists of intensive didactic, clinical, and research components.\nThe program offers evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment planning as well as the didactic courses such as Biomechanics and Growth and Development. Residents are expected to actively participate by presenting cases in diagnostic presentations, seminars, and literature review. Clinical evaluation by OSCE is one of the unique quantitative evaluation methods used in the program. \u00a0\nResidents are provided with a large number of patients including orthognathic surgery, cleft lip and palate, craniofacial anomaly, and interdisciplinary cases. Residents gain valuable experience in diagnosis, treatment planning, orthodontic therapy, and patient management. Residents are exposed to various treatment techniques and appliances from talented and experienced groups of full- and part-time faculty, which teaches them to render proficient orthodontic care to patients throughout their professional career. Contemporary advanced technology, such as digital imaging, digital diagnostic records, and computer stimulated diagnosis and arch wires are integrated into the program. All residents are mentored and encouraged to be ABO certified orthodontists.\u00a0\nUnder the guidance of the research program director, residents develop a research project and are expected to present their research at the meeting (AAO, IADR, AADR etc.,). Residents are also required to publish their manuscript to a\u00a0 refereed journal by graduation. This process promotes creative thinking, critical analysis, and teaches residents to recognize the importance of evidence-based knowledge. Residences are provided with experience in biomedical sciences, scientific methodology, and research techniques so they may develop an appreciation for the biological and scientific aspects of orthodontics.\nResidents are required to participate in teaching predoctoral students for their orthodontic cases. Residents are also encouraged to serve diverse populations of patients, their communities, and the profession, and to advance specialty of orthodontics by participating in teaching activities throughout their careers.\n\n\u00a9 2022, The Ohio State University College of Dentistry\nPostle Hall\n305 W. 12th Avenue\nColumbus, OH 43210-1267\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nProspective Students\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have trouble accessing this page and need to request an alternate format, please contact our webmaster.\nPrivacy Policy"},

Initially, the student is introduced to the preventive aspects of dental care in children. Dental care prevention is especially stressed, including the use of systemic and topical fluorides, occlusal sealant application, and diet modification. Restorative care and appliance therapy for children are also taught with equal emphasis placed upon the technical aspects of treatment and treatment rationale. The development of occlusion from the prenatal period through adolescence is presented, and what constitutes a normal occlusion is described. Students learn to recognize malocclusion, identify the concomitant etiologic factors, and are taught to prevent, intercept or treat minor problems of the occlusion. The didactic program continues in the third year with an emphasis on behavior management in children, orthodontic considerations for the adult patient, and literature review. Clinical sessions in children's dentistry begin in the student's second year with bimonthly sessions and increase to two half-day sessions/week in the third year. Students provide comprehensive care to infants, children, and adolescents including those who require extensive needs or exhibit behavioral concerns. Emphasis is on risk assessment, treatment planning, and the application of therapies best designed to optimize the potential oral health of the individual patient and their family.\u00a0 Students also participate with faculty and residents in community outreach programs that are coordinated throughout their second and third years.\n\nFor those students who have an interest in furthering their experiences with pediatric patients, the department offers selectives to fourth-year students both at the school and at affiliated institutions. This program allows students to strengthen their pediatric dentistry skills through a weekly rotation during their fourth year. In addition, these elite individuals gain worthwhile experience on the clinic floor working closely with faculty and teaching underclassmen. In addition, a fourth-year clinical program in dental care for the developmentally disabled is provided.\n\u00a0\nAdvanced Education Program in Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics\nProgram Director: Dr. Richard D.

The program consists of expanded course-work, the conduct of an approved research project, the submission of a formal thesis and of a publishable article to a refereed journal. The program usually requires a minimum of 30 months to complete.\nThe M.S. degree program is administrated by the Graduate College and is not administratively related to the certificate program; there is no clinical component, and extra course work may be required depending on the student's area of study. However, the certificate of specialization program completion is contingent on completion of a M.S. degree program.\nAn application to the Graduate College for the M.S. program must be completed by the student to take the graduate degree program concurrently. Applicants are required to seek a graduate degree (M.S. or Ph.D.) so they must meet the admission requirements of the Graduate College and the MSIA Program.\u00a0\nPh.D. Program A program may be designed that combines a certificate and a Ph.D. through the Medical Sciences Interdepartmental Area in one of the participating departments, such as Oral Biology. Extra time will be needed to meet the requirements of the Ph.D. degree. This program is structured for an individual planning on a full-time career in academics and research.\nIn addition to the program of study required by the Postgraduate Education Committee, the following are expected to be satisfactorily completed during the training program and prior to the granting of the Certificate of Specialization in Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics.\nProfessional Presentations During the Spring Semester of the first year, each student will be required to present at the annual session of the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO). During the Spring Semester of the second year, each student will be required to present at the annual Midwest Student Biomedical Research Forum, at the College of Dentistry's annual Student Scientific Program and at the AAO annual session. In the second year, students will be encouraged to present at the annual meeting of the American Association for Dental Research. In the Fall Semester of the third year, each student will be required to present at a designated meeting of the Lincoln Orthodontic Society.\nEmergencies and Pain Control The College of Dentistry has determined that a course in Emergencies and Pain Control and participation on the CODE BLUE team and the After Hours Emergency Care Program are parts of the academic program for all postgraduate students who are eligible for licensure in Nebraska and who accept GME funding. The course will be scheduled during the first year as a required course for all new postgraduate students.\nExaminations An objective standardized clinical examination (OSCE) will be given to students annually in order to help monitor their progress and identify strengths and deficiencies. A departmental clinical comprehensive examination will be given to all third-year residents during the Fall Semester. Details of the examination procedure will be available at least six weeks prior to the scheduled time and will follow a format similar to that of the American Board of Orthodontics.\nTeaching Participation in undergraduate teaching is a required activity for second year postgraduate students. A regular or temporary Nebraska Dental License is mandatory for postgraduate students who are eligible for licensure in Nebraska. Teaching experience under the supervision of faculty will be available to students who graduated from Non-U.S./Canadian dental schools and are not eligible for licensure in Nebraska.\nResearch Project A research project is required. The project is part of the requirement for an advanced academic degree (M.S. or Ph.D.) and the complete M.S. thesis or Ph.D. dissertation must be received and approved by the Graduate College before the Certificate of Specialization will be awarded.\nOff-Site Education Clinical experiences for students include a periodic rotation to participate with the Boys Town National Research Hospital Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Team where students will evaluate and plan treatment for children with craniofacial birth defects.\nImmunizationsThe University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry policy requires that all entering students in programs requiring patient contact must be vaccinated or exhibit active immunity to tetanus, measles, mumps, diphtheria, chicken pox, polio, rubella and hepatitis B and have had a TB skin test within the last six months, unless the student has a previous positive test/medical contraindication. Each entering student must verify at the time of matriculation that he or she has completed the accepted routine of vaccinations. An immunization record is required in order for the student to be registered. Anyone born after 1957 is required to have two measles shots to assure immunity, with the second one given after 1980.\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Each student is required to be certified and maintain certification in basic CPR. A copy of the valid certification in basic CPR must be maintained at the College of Dentistry.\nStipendGraduate Medical Education (GME) funding allocations by UNMC must be established before resident stipends for the year can be established.\u00a0Residents will be assigned a 1.0 FTE status which makes them eligible for a flexible benefit package which includes choices among health, life and disability insurance. Future income is contingent upon continued availability of federal funds and, therefore, is subject to change at any time.\nTuition ScholarshipsGME-eligible postgraduate students are considered full-time employees of the University and, as such, are eligible for employee tuition scholarships for graduate credit hours. This permits the GME-eligible student to enroll for up to 15 credit hours per year. No more than 6 credit hours may be taken in each of the fall and spring semesters, and three credit hours may be taken in the summer. Established postgraduate fees for the postgraduate program will continue.\nStudent Loans and Loan DefermentPostgraduate students are considered students of the College of Dentistry for financial aid purposes. Postgraduate students may get financial aid information from the UNMC Financial Aid Office.\u00a0Student loan payments for postgraduate students can be deferred.\nVacation/Sick Leave Postgraduate students who accept stipends shall have ten (10) scheduled working days of paid leave per year. Leave includes vacation and sick leave. Leave in excess of ten (10) days per year must be taken as Leave Without Pay from the College or as Family Leave. Students who do not have stipends shall have ten (10) scheduled working days of leave per year for vacation and/or sick leave with provision for Family Leave as per University policies. Leave requests must be submitted as per the policies of the program and the College. Students have additional vacation days that do not count toward the 10-day limit when the University is closed (e.g., the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, but not including spring break or spring/summer semester break).\nPrivate Practice Private practice of dentistry is not permitted under any circumstances at any time while a postgraduate student is in this postgraduate program unless there has been specific approval from the Program Director and the Director of Postgraduate and Graduate Dental Education.\nState of Nebraska Residency As employees of the University, GME-eligible postgraduate students are considered to be residents of the State of Nebraska. Ordinarily students who are not GME-eligible may be considered not residents of the State of Nebraska.\nNon-U.S./Canadian Degree Students Foreign-trained dentists (non U.S./Canadian dental degree) may apply for the postgraduate program. The following financial stipulations normally apply for foreign-trained dentists who are accepted and enrolled in the postgraduate program.\u00a0They are not eligible to receive a GME funded stipends or benefits.\u00a0An individual who moves to Nebraska primarily to enroll in a post-secondary institution will be considered a nonresident for tuition purposes for the duration of his or her attendance.\n2020-21 Program Costs\nFor postgraduate students with a U.S. or Canadian dental degree, and Nebraska residents.\nClinical Fees $2,806 Fall Term (July 1-December 31) $2,806 Spring Term (January 1-June 30) $5,612 Per Year\nEquipment Assessment $2,050 Per Year\nOrthodontic Course $2,500 Per Year\nTotal $10,162 Per Year\nOne time $30 fee for background check.\nResidents are expected to provide their own Canon EOS Rebel XSI (12mp) camera equipped for intra-oral high-quality photos (Mini Macro Ring and Point Flash) by the beginning of clinic during fall of the first year in the program.\nThe University of Nebraska has professional liability insurance covering all students within the College of Dentistry. Current coverage is $1,000,000 per person, per occurrence, with a $100,000 deductible. The University provides self insurance for the $100,000 deductible through the University's general and professional liability insurance program.\nPostgraduate students who are eligible for licensure in Nebraska and who accept GME funding are expected to obtain a Nebraska Dental License (temporary or regular) and federal and state DEA licenses before October 15 of the year of the commencement of their program so that they can participate in the After Hours Emergency Care Program. The postgraduate student must document efforts to obtain licensure to the Postgraduate Admissions Office by July 15. Failure to obtain Nebraska Dental License and federal and state DEA licenses by October 15 may result in a reduction of duties and reduction or elimination of stipend.\nIt is possible for a student who has graduated from an ADA-accredited (American or Canadian) dental school to obtain a temporary Nebraska dental license during the time he or she is enrolled as a full time postgraduate student. The temporary license is only for practice-related activities within the College of Dentistry and does not allow extramural private practice. After acceptance into the postgraduate program, licensure information may be obtained from the State of Nebraska Department of Health, Bureau of Examining Boards.\nFor a regular license, the State Board accepts the results of the clinical examination given by the Central Regional Dental Testing Service. The State Board also has provisions for licensure by credentials for individuals licensed in other states.\nIn accordance with University policy, UNMC prohibits the denial of admission or of Medical Center privileges to students or applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, disability or religious or political beliefs. These privileges include but are not limited to admission, class assignments, scholarships, fellowships, assistantships, and financial aid, as well as housing and recreational facilities. Furthermore, student organizations must base their selection of students for membership in criteria which will not include race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.\nAdmittance to UNMC programs will not be denied to otherwise qualified disabled individuals solely by reason of their disability. Qualified disabled persons are those who meet the academic and technical standards for each program. These nonacademic skills are essential to successful program completion.\nIn summary, UNMC policies are in accord with:\nThe objective of the University of Nebraska Medical Center is to recruit and retain persons of high moral and ethical character. In accordance with this objective, the University of Nebraska Medical Center reserves the right to review a candidate's suitability for admission.\nMeenakshi (Minnie) Vishwanath, BDS, MDS, MDentScInterim Program DirectorUNMC College of Dentistry4000 East Campus Loop SouthLincoln, NE 68583-0740402-472-1302minnie.vishwanath@unmc.edu\nPostgraduate Dental Programs Julie Buss UNMC College of Dentistry 4000 East Campus Loop SouthLincoln, NE 68583-0740402-472-6261jbuss@unmc.edu"},

Graduates leave SLU prepared to be astute and aware clinicians using an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to caring for craniofacial and dental patient problems.\nSaint Louis University's orthodontic program offers three basic areas of training: an extensive and comprehensive clinical experience that involves diagnosis, treatment planning, active treatment and retention of patients representing a variety of malocclusions and craniofacial deformities; core courses that include biomedical sciences and clinical concepts; and orthodontic research. Students will need to complete 88 credits to graduate.\nSpecific courses include facial development, biomechanics, clinical cephalometrics, oral biology, surgical orthodontics, orthodontic problems related to the cleft-palate patient, speech problems related to the oral mechanism, history of orthodontics, diagnosis and treatment planning, clinical diagnosis, orthodontic analysis and treatment modalities, introduction to clinical orthodontics, principles of orthodontic techniques, seminar on child and adolescent psychology, digital orthodontics, scenario-based case analysis, orthodontic business management, review for the ABO examination and thesis research.\nFollowing preliminary laboratory and classroom instruction, each resident in the orthodontic program initiates treatment on a large number of patients who present a broad array of dental malocclusions and skeletal deformities. Although residents are first introduced to the Tweed edgewise philosophy form of treatment, students are also exposed to Tip-Edge mechanics (the sequel to Begg therapy), functional and other removable appliances, and various straight wire appliances. The supervising faculty members\u00a0present their philosophies and techniques by means of lectures, seminars, laboratory exercises and demonstrations.\nIn the clinic, students are exposed to a wide array of patient types. Children, adolescents and adults are treated; consequently, students are exposed to treatment in the deciduous, mixed and adult dentitions. Students are also exposed to cases with compromised oral health that require consideration of periodontal, restorative and temporomandibular joint treatment. As a result, many patients are treated by an interdisciplinary approach with other healthcare professionals. Throughout the clinical experience, each student receives a great deal of faculty attention. The development of diagnostic and treatment skills is emphasized as a major responsibility to students.\nAdditional courses and seminars augment the clinical experience, covering the topics of diagnosis and treatment planning, cephalometrics, theoretical and practical biomechanics, oral pathology, oral medicine, multidisciplinary treatment, speech disorders, craniofacial defects with particular emphasis on cleft lip/palate rehabilitation, adolescent and adult psychology, implants, dentofacial orthopedics, surgical orthodontics, TMJ disorders, and practice management.\nStudents also receive training in research design and statistics and must conduct an original research project. This effort leads to the preparation and defense of a thesis and, subsequently, the production of a manuscript suitable for publication in a journal relating to the specialty of orthodontics. The experience of discovery provided by such research is an integral part of the graduate program, and students are expected to produce a meaningful contribution to the field of orthodontics.\nOur goal is to prepare orthodontic graduates to pursue a career with many possibilities: as a clinician with a practice limited to orthodontics, as a researcher or as a teacher of orthodontics.\nA D.D.S., D.M.D., or equivalent general dental degree is required for matriculation in this and all other Saint Louis University Center for Advanced Dental Education dental training programs.\u00a0\nAll admission policies and requirements for domestic students apply to international students along with the following:\nApplications must be completed by Sept. 1 to be considered for the orthodontic program beginning the summer semester of the following year.\nPromising applicants are invited for on-site interviews beginning in October. The orthodontic program subscribes to a national matching service and the \"tell date\" occurs in late November or early December.\nFor priority consideration for graduate assistantship, apply by Feb. 1.\u00a0\nFor more information, visit the student financial services office online at http://finaid.slu.edu. \u00a0\nThe orthodontic program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association.

Having partnered with Rainbow Babies &amp; Children's Hospital, Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine is taking the lead to fight against early childhood cavities, the number one chronic infectious disease in children in America.\u00a0Learn about the Headstart Program.\nThe purpose of the Healthy Smiles Sealant Program is to provide high quality oral health education, examinations, preventive services (dental sealants) and referrals for children in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District (CMSD) while exposing dental students to the needs of under-served children and the communities in which they live.\nTemporary clinics are set up at each CMSD elementary school, where pre-doctoral dental students perform dental exams and apply sealants to children in grades 2, 3 and 6. Children with cavities have the cavity-free teeth sealed and are referred by our program coordinator to a community dentist or a safety-net provider for treatment of the diseased teeth. Prior to treatment, health educators visit the schools to teach children about general health care, oral health care, and nutritional health.\u00a0Lesson plans for teachers are provided monthly to reinforce the message conveyed by the health educators.\u00a0Learn about the Sealant Program."},

hospital- and health-center based education program that provides a strong didactic and clinical foundation in Pediatric Dentistry. Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum: In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology.\u00a0\r\nProgram Strengths: Residents receive a rich, comprehensive and robust education. Second year residents are well prepared to take the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry (ABPD)\u00a0Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part ABPD certification process. The majority of NYU Langone Dental Medicine PEDS residents pass the QE and go on to\u00a0become board-certified diplomates of the ABPD.\r\nResearch: Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting. \r\nNYU Langone Dental Medicine PEDS-RHODE ISLAND: The Pediatric Dental Center (PDC), St. Joseph Health Center, Prospect CharterCare SJHSRI, LLC is home to the NYU Langone Dental Medicine Pediatric Dentistry\u00a0Program in RI. In addition to the Providence site, residents complete sedation cases and perform full-mouth oral rehabilitation under general anesthesia at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence, RI.\r\nServing primarily low-income and underserved children statewide, the PDC is located in one of the state's most underserved neighborhoods. Pediatric patients, from birth to age 18 years, are of diverse race and ethnicity (Hispanic, African-American, White/non-Hispanic, and Asian). Approximately 25% of patients have special health care needs including, but not limited to, autism, asthma, ADD/ADHD, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and craniofacial anomalies.\r\nWith modern clinical facilities and more than 20 operatories, residents will have access to electronic dental records, digital radiography, and a dedicated operating room suite for conscious sedation and/or general anesthesia. Residents typically complete 80+ cases in the OR and the CODA-required 50 oral conscious sedations (25 as the operator; 25 as monitor) in our state-of-the-art dental suite at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital. All residents work with a dental assistant, treat a large number of patients, and acquire a wide variety of clinical skills that prepares graduates to practice competently and confidently in any setting.\r\nPEDS residents are actively involved with the Craniofacial Team at Hasbro Children's Hospital and gain experience in nasoalveolar molding-NAM,\u00a0an early presurgical intervention for infants with cleft lip/cleft palate. In partnership with community dentists,\u00a0residents\u00a0also have the opportunity to learn about\u00a0laser dentistry.\u00a0Through after hours on-call rotations in the Hasbro Emergency Department, residents gain skill in managing many trauma cases. Residents complete rotations at The Tomorrow Fund Clinic and gain exposure to pediatric patients receiving care for a variety of blood disorders or cancers. Residents also rotate through Hasbro's Refugee Health Clinic to triage and refer children new to RI for necessary dental services.\r\nIn Year 2, residents teach dental students from Tufts University and gain exposure to collaborative community activities and policy advocacy efforts with state/national partners.\r\nFor questions about the NYU Langone Dental Medicine-RI site, contact Dr. Kane, Program Director.

Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum:\u00a0In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology. Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community. \r\nProgram Strengths:\u00a0\r\nResidents receive a rich, comprehensive\u00a0and robust education. Second year residents are well prepared\u00a0to take the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry\u00a0(ABPD) Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part\u00a0ABPD certification process. The majority of NYU Langone Dental\u00a0Medicine PEDS residents pass the QE go on to become board certified\u00a0diplomates of the ABPD.\r\nResearch:\u00a0Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting. The best research projects are also presented at the annual Research Fair in Brooklyn, NY.\r\nNYU Langone Dental Medicine Advanced Education in Pediatric Dentistry-Alaska:\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAlaska Native Medical Center is the primary referral center for Alaska Native/American Indian people throughout the vast state of Alaska.\u00a0 As part of this innovative, thriving, integrated healthcare campus, the pediatric dentistry residency program offers a wide array of uncommon learning experiences.\u00a0 With an emphasis on basic behavior guidance, sedation, and general anesthesia, residents care for pediatric patients using state-of-the-art supplies and equipment in 8 quiet rooms, 12 open-bay operatories, and 3 surgery suites.\u00a0 Residents learn from 8 board-certified pediatric dental faculty, in collaboration with a team of 2 orthodontists, 4 oral surgeons, 2 endodontists, 3 prosthodontists, a periodontist, and a large staff of general dentists, hygienists, and certified dental assistants.\u00a0\r\nResidents at the Alaska site MUST be licensed to practice dentistry in the State of Alaska.\u00a0 The Alaska site offers reimbursement of State of Alaska Dental License fees to residents who match at the site and complete onboarding requirements.\u00a0 For licensure details, please visit the website of the Alaska Board of Dental Examiners: https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/professionallicensing/boardofdentalexaminers.aspx\r\nFor questions about NYU Langone Dental Medicine Advanced Education in Pediatric Dentistry-Alaska, please contact Dr. Kayla Carver, Associate Program Director (Email: Kayla.Carver@nyulangone.org or kcarver@southcentralfoundation.com). \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

Through the affiliation with NYU Langone Dental Medicine\u2019s\u00a0Advanced Education in Pediatric Dentistry Program, residents at our DSE training site can expect to become well-trained pediatric dentists who are sensitive to community and family oral health care needs of pediatric and special needs populations in the State of Tennessee. There will be ample opportunity to treat a wide-range of oral health issues as our population of patients have an above average incidence of oral diseases.\nDSE\u2019s clinical training site,\u00a0Children\u2019s Dental Health Center (CDHC), has 11 operatories dedicated to pediatric dentistry. It is the primary location for clinical training. Many specialty clinics and affiliations support the residency program. Residents participate in after-hours on-call, in-patient pediatric medicine, pediatric sub-specialties and cleft palate team rotations. Several outpatient surgery centers will serve as rotations for the operating room.\nCDHC is located in a poor urban neighborhood, located just two miles outside the central business district of Nashville. CDHC is one of the only dental clinics in the greater Nashville market that provides transport services. During the past twelve months the clinic has managed over 32,000 patient interactions and is actively growing. The neighborhood where CDHC is located represents the most clinically at-risk populations in Greater Nashville. The population is principally African American and Hispanic children balanced equally between genders. The primary payment mechanism (94%+) is TennCare (state based Medicaid), followed by private insurance (3%) and private pay (3%).\nDSE has support staff and each resident will have one designated dental assistant for each clinic session. All staff involved in direct patient care are current with BLS/CPR certification and the residents and supervising pediatric dentists are ACLS/PALS certified. Digital intraoral and extraoral radiographic equipment is available within the dental center. Sedations and OR cases will be performed at the Specialty Surgery Center and the Oral Surgery anesthesiologists. DSE pediatric dental faculty will teach and supervise the anesthesia procedures performed by the residents. A pediatric dentist is always present to supervise the resident providing oral health care.\nA private conference room and resident office space with computers are available within DSE\u2019s dental clinics. The residents have access to the NYU Langone Dental Medicine Health Science Library online and its numerous medical and dental resource databases, including online dental journal subscriptions and drug reference information.\nDental Specialty Education, Inc739 President Place #210\u00a0Nashville, TN 37167\nDr. John KenneyAssociate Directorfrnscdds@aol.comjohn.kenney@nyulangone.org\u00a0\nDental Specialty Education (DSE), Inc.739 President Place #210 Nashville, Tennessee 37167\nChildren\u2019s Dental Health Center 447-451 Murfreesboro Road Nashville, Tennessee 37167"},

This program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association\u2019s Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The goal of the program is to prepare pediatric dentists who are proficient in providing primary and comprehensive preventive and therapeutic care for infants and children through adolescence, including those with special needs.\nResidents receive extensive clinical and didactic training in Pediatric Dentistry including, but not limited to, comprehensive care of both healthy and special needs children and adolescents, restorative dentistry, pulp therapy, periodontal therapy, oral surgery, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic behavior management techniques, space maintenance, orthodontic therapy, growth and development, treatment of patients under conscious sedation, treatment of patients in the operating room under general anesthesia, and management of traumatic injuries and emergency care.\nHospital rotations include General Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Craniofacial/Cleft Palate Clinic, Sedation, Oncology, Spina Bifida Clinic, General and Craniofacial Surgery, and Emergency Department. Hospital rotations help residents gain a deeper understanding of medical conditions and learn to work closely with medical colleagues and other members of the health care team. Residents have time designated for research and involvement in community activities. They also teach at the Penn Dental Medicine Pediatric Dentistry Clinic. Elective rotations and continuing education opportunities are also encouraged. The program promotes critical thinking and inquiry in order to be able to participate in practice, education, and research in institutional, private, and public health settings; and to prepare residents to grow into leadership roles in Pediatric Dentistry.\nThe highly respected research environment at Penn Dental Medicine and throughout the University of Pennsylvania provides a valuable opportunity for students applying to residency programs to combine their specialty training with advanced research and academic opportunities. To that end, Penn Dental Medicine offers a Master of Science in Oral Biology and a Doctor of Science in Dentistry that can be earned concurrent with a specialty certificate, preparing students to successfully enter the field of academic dentistry while also becoming skilled clinicians in specialty care.

{"title": "Pediatric Dentistry, M.S. in Dentistry : SLU", "body": "The Center for Advanced Dental Education at Saint Louis University offers a program in the specialty of pediatric dentistry that leads to a Master of Science in Dentistry and a certificate in pediatric dentistry. The program is designed to meet the educational requirements for limitation of practice to pediatric dentistry and examination by the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry. \nEmphasis is placed on all phases of pediatric dentistry. At the end of the program, the student will be able to provide comprehensive oral health care for the well child, the medically compromised child and the child with special health care needs. Extensive experience is provided in the areas of sedation, analgesia and the use of general anesthesia to deliver dental treatment. Research experience is gained through completion of a master\u2019s thesis research project.\nThe pediatric dental postgraduate program is located in a newly remodeled six-chair clinic. Each operatory is equipped with digital radiographic capabilities and nitrous oxide. A small office area, as well as break room, library and classrooms are provided for the residents.\nSeminars are held that cover topics relevant to pediatric dentistry, and a literature review course will discuss current and core articles from the pediatric dental literature. Multi-disciplinary seminars are held in conjunction with the graduate programs in orthodontics, endodontics and periodontics. Formal courses are presented in biostatistics, oral medicine, oral pathology, early and mixed dentition, therapeutics, practice management and some basic sciences. Off-service rotations occur in general anesthesia, pediatric medicine, pediatric emergency room and craniofacial clinic. 51 credits are required to complete the program.\nStudents will gain operating room experience and complete clinical rotations at SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children\u2019s Hospital. Residents provide 24-hour/seven-days-a-week dental consultation to the Cardinal Glennon emergency room, a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center.\nStudents also receive training in research design and statistics and must conduct an original research project. This effort leads to the preparation and defense of a thesis and, subsequently, the production of a manuscript suitable for publication in a journal relating to the specialty of pediatric dentistry. The experience of discovery provided by such research is an integral part of the graduate program, and students are expected to produce a meaningful contribution to the field of pediatric dentistry.\nOur goal is to prepare pediatric dentistry graduates to pursue a career with many possibilities: as a clinician with a practice limited to pediatric dentistry, as a researcher or as a teacher of pediatric dentistry.\nThe prerequisite for matriculation in any CADE dental training program is possession of a D.D.S., D.M.D., or equivalent general dental degree. \u00a0Additionally, individuals must be able to obtain a Missouri Dental License.\nAll admission policies and requirements for domestic students apply to international students along with the following:\nApplications must be completed by Oct. 1 to be considered for the pediatric dentistry master\u2019s program beginning the summer semester of the following year.\nA committee examines and reviews the applicant and application wholly.

Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference (VTC) system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum: In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology. Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community. \r\nProgram Strengths:\u00a0\r\nResidents receive a rich, comprehensive\u00a0and robust education. Second year residents are well prepared\u00a0to take the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry\u00a0(ABPD) Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part\u00a0ABPD certification process. The majority of NYU Langone Dental\u00a0Medicine PEDS residents pass the QE go on to become board certified\u00a0diplomates of the ABPD.\r\n\u00a0\r\nResearch: Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting. The best research projects are also presented at the annual Research Fair in\u00a0Brooklyn, NY.\r\nNYU Langone Dental Medicine, Advanced Education in Pediatric Dentistry -CALIFORNIA:\u00a0 Thank you for your interest in the NYU Langone Advanced Education in Pediatric Dentistry Program-San Diego site.

{"title": "Periodontics | School of Dental Medicine | Case Western Reserve University", "body": "Dr. Gian Pietro Schincaglia joined Case Western Reserve University\u00a0from West Virginia University (WVU) where he was a tenured professor, chair and graduate program director of the Department of Periodontics in the School of Dentistry.\u00a0While at WVU, Schincaglia started the robotic dental implant program, establishing the university as the second institution in the nation to offer robotic-guided implant surgeries. Prior to his role with WVU, he was an associate professor with tenure and chair of oral implantology for the School of Dentistry at the University of Ferrara in Italy; and a clinical associate professor and graduate program director for the Division of Periodontology, Department of Oral Health &amp; Diagnostic Sciences at the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine.\u00a0\nSchincaglia\u00a0spent time specializing in periodontics and implants in private practice, as well as with the faculty practice at the UConn Center for Implant and Reconstructive Dentistry in Farmington, CT. He received his degree in dental surgery from the University of Ferrara School of Dentistry in 1989, a certificate in periodontics from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles in 2000 and a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology from the University of Ferrara in 2006. In 2003, he became a diplomate of the American Board of Periodontology.\u00a0\nThe Department of Periodontics is glad to present its well-trained residents, welcoming staff, and globally recognized clinical faculty, who are specialists in treating gum diseases and maintaining the mouth in a healthy state. Placement of dental implants to replace missing teeth is also offered to our patients. Advanced x-ray imaging and conscious sedation are also available in the clinic of graduate periodontics.\nDr. Leena Palomo, Assistant Professor in the Department of Periodontics, was recently selected for the American Association of Dental Research (AADR)'s Strides in Science monthly feature, which highlights the accomplishments of AADR members. Dr. Palomo discussed her research focus on bone changes of postmenopausal women and her desire to use her research and teaching to do something useful for society, as well as the ways in which her AADR membership has helped her pursue those goals.\nRead the Strides in Science column.\nAccording to various studies conducted by Dr. Bissada and his faculty and students, a link between oral and general health has been established. Taking care of your oral/periodontal health may have a positive impact on your general health. For example, this photograph demonstrates reduction in the swelling of hands' joints due to rheumatoid arthritis after getting rid of infection and inflammation in the mouth.\nThe American Association for Dental Research (AADR) named Leena Palomo, assistant professor in the Department of Periodontics in the School of Dental Medicine, as the recipient of the 2012 AADR William B. Clark Fellowship in Clinical Research. This award, which recognizes investigators carrying out clinical research in periodontology, will be presented at the AADR Annual Meeting &amp; Exhibition in Tampa, Florida on March 24. The fellowship was established in memory of William B. Clark and is supported by P&amp;G Professional Oral Health, Crest Oral-B.\nPalomo plans to collect subgingival biofilm and crevicular fluid samples from a population of otherwise healthy postmenopausal women diagnosed with periodontitis who are using bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and samples from demographically matched postmenopausal women who do not use such therapy. Microbial species and cytokine response between the two groups will be compared."},

program is a 24-month hospital- and health-center based education program that provides a strong didactic and clinical foundation in Pediatric Dentistry. \u00a0Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA).\u00a0 The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs.\u00a0 Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience.\u00a0 Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. \u00a0With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. \u00a0Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum:\u00a0\u00a0In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing the majority of biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. \u00a0At most sites, residents have the opportunity to attend monthly craniofacial conferences. \u00a0Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects.\u00a0 Additionally, first-year residents are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the focus of the curriculum is on children with complex medical conditions.\u00a0 Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology.\u00a0 Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nProgram Strengths:\u00a0\u00a0American Board of Pediatric Dentistry (ABPD) Outcomes:\u00a0 Second year residents are required to take the ABPD Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part ABPD certification process.\u00a0 Over 90% of LMC PEDS residents pass the QE (national average 85%).\u00a0 More than 70% of graduates become board-certified diplomates of the ABPD (national average 65%).\u00a0\r\nResearch:\u00a0Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting.\u00a0 The best research projects are also presented at the annual Research Fair in\u00a0Brooklyn, NY.\u00a0\r\nNYU Langone Dental Medicine PEDS-ARIZONA/Tucson:\u00a0\u00a0NYU Langone Dental Medicine, Tucson, Arizona site\u00a0offers a unique experience unlike traditional hospital or university based pediatric dentistry programs. Residents receive their pediatric dental clinical training serving the community by caring for patients in community health centers in collaboration with medical staff.\u00a0 Affiliated hospitals provide hospital and medical rotations required for specialty training. \u00a0Throughout their residency, traveling is required as pediatric residents rotate through assignments in the Tucson area.\u00a0 Emphasis at the El Rio Community Health Center is placed on the treatment of the well child in a community health center setting.\u00a0 Unique experiences include multiple moderate sedation and in-office general anesthesia cases.\u00a0 Additionally, experience is provided in interceptive orthodontics and public health outreach.\u00a0 Rotations occur throughout Tucson and include:\u00a0 Anesthesia at Tucson Medical Center; On-call and emergency medicine at Banner University Medical Center; Medically compromised patients and Cleft lip/palate clinics at Children\u2019s Clinics at Tucson Medical Center; Pediatric medicine at University Medical Center Sub-Specialty Clinics and Diamond Children\u2019s Hospital, and dental rotations at various health centers.\u00a0 In addition, rotations at the El Rio Community Health Center may include Saturday assignments for pre-natal education and outreach events.\u00a0 Mandatory literature review, resident meetings, and other didactic assignments, which include presentations, may be assigned on weekend or after clinic hours.\r\nFor questions about the NYU Langone Dental Medicine AZ/Tucson site, please contact Dr. Amanda Pinder, Associate Director.\u00a0\r\nPhone: 520-310-5450\u00a0 Email:\u00a0amandap@elrio.org\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum: In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\u00a0\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology. Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community. \r\nProgram Strengths: American Board of Pediatric Dentistry (ABPD) Outcomes: Second year residents are required to take the ABPD Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part ABPD certification process. Over 90% of\u00a0NYU Langone\u00a0PEDS residents pass the QE (national average 85%). More than 70% of graduates become board-certified diplomates of the ABPD (national average 65%).\r\nResearch: Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting. The best research projects are also presented at the annual Research Fair in\u00a0Brooklyn, NY.\r\nNYU Langone Dental Medicine PEDS-FLORIDA:\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThis residency site is affiliated with Suncoast Community Health Centers, Inc. The site has two state of the art pediatric dental clinics. The primary training site is located within the Brandon Community Health Center, and a second clinic is located within Plant City Family Care. Both pediatric clinics are equipped with Adec equipment, paperless charting, flat-panel cable TV monitors in each operatory, LED lighting, digital radiography, and paperless charting. The primary training site also includes 3D computed tomography, Solea CO2 soft and hard\u00a0tissue laser, and an additional anesthesia suite with a separate recovery room.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nA large emphasis is placed on sedation, general anesthesia,\u00a0interceptive orthodontics, oral surgery, inpatient and outpatient pediatric medicine, special patient care, community outreach, and advocacy.\u00a0The two hospitals that are affiliated with this site are a level one trauma teaching hospital, Tampa General Hospital, and a regional medical center, South Florida Baptist Hospital.\u00a0We are currently working on affiliating with a third hospital.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThis residency site is growing rapidly with operating room and sedations weekly. Residents gain experience in moderate sedation using all modalities of medication administration (nasal, intravenous, intramuscular and oral). The residents complete sedation and general anesthesia cases well beyond the number required by CODA\u2019s accreditation standards.\u00a0Interceptive orthodontics is supervised by our three orthodontists, thus providing a solid foundation on the practice of orthodontics that prepares the graduate to pursue additional training in comprehensive orthodontics.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nFor questions about the Tampa site, please contact Dr. Priyanka Iyer, Associate Director.\u00a0Email: PIyer@suncoast-chc.org\u00a0or Lilllian Villarreal, Residency Coordinator.

Founded in 1994 by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum:\u00a0In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology. Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community. \r\nProgram Strengths:\u00a0Residents receive a rich, comprehensive\u00a0and robust education. Second year residents are well prepared\u00a0to take the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry\u00a0(ABPD) Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part\u00a0ABPD certification process. The majority of NYU Langone Dental\u00a0Medicine PEDS residents pass the QE go on to become board certified\u00a0diplomates of the ABPD.\r\nResearch: Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting.\r\n\r\nNYU Langone Hospitals Pediatric Dentistry-MASSACHUSETTS:\u00a0 The NYU Langone Dental Medicine Pediatric Dentistry residency in Holyoke, Massachusetts provides an enriching experience.\u00a0 The first year training is supplemented with anesthesia and emergency medicine rotations at Baystate Medical Center and out-patient pediatric rotations at the Holyoke Health Center Pediatric Department. The second year training is supplemented with sub-specialty rotations in cleft lip/palate at Shriner\u2019s Hospital\u00a0for Children\u00a0and pediatric in-patient and out-patient at Baystate Medical Center, a level-one trauma center and the major hospital of Western Massachusetts with adjoining children\u2019s hospital. The second year residents also spend sessions teaching undergraduate dental students at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. During both training years, residents participated in an integrated medical-dental treatment rotation at the Holyoke Health Center pediatrics clinic. Clinical training occurs primarily at the Holyoke Health Center pediatric dentistry clinic.

Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum: In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology. Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community. \r\nProgram Strengths: American Board of Pediatric Dentistry (ABPD) Outcomes: Second year residents are required to take the ABPD Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part ABPD certification process. Over 90% of NYU Langone Dental Medicine PEDS residents pass the QE (national average 85%). More than 70% of graduates become board-certified diplomates of the ABPD (national average 65%).\r\nResearch: Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting. The best research projects are also presented at the annual Research Fair, Brooklyn, NY.\r\nNYU Langone\u00a0Dental Medicine PEDS-MARYLAND: \u00a0The Princess Anne, and the Salisbury, Maryland sites serve the underserved population of the three lower counties of the Delmarva Peninsula, providing comprehensive clinical care, oral conscious sedation, and hospital dentistry.\u00a0\u00a0The dental facilities are newer and very modern.\u00a0 The program has hospital affiliations with Tidal Health and\u00a0Tidal Health\u00a0Surgery Center with rotations in Anesthesia, Emergency Medicine, Pediatric Medicine, Endocrinology, Cardiology, and Phlebotomy. Residents participate \u00a0in an observational orthodontic private practice rotation, local supplemental didactic curriculum and \u00a0Community outreach services (e.g. Sealant/ fluoride varnish application;\u00a0dental screenings)\u00a0is a strength in our site.\r\nFor questions about the NYU Langone Dental Medicine - MD site, please contact Dr. Mariella De Stefano, Associate Program Director.\u00a0 Phone: 410-651-4030.\u00a0 Email: mdestefano@chesapeakehc.org\r\n\u00a0 \r\n                            \r\n                          \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tProgram\u00a0Requirements\u00a0Part\u00a0I\u00a0\u2191\u00a0\r\n   \t  \r\n                 \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t       Program Specific Requirements\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Required:\u00a0No\r\n                         ADA ADAT Scores are Accepted but Not Required:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must upload unofficial undergraduate transcripts to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit Dental School transcripts to the program (in addition to ADEA PASS):\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must report GRE scores in the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must submit original GRE scores to the program:\u00a0No\r\r\n                         Must upload a CV/Resume to the ADEA PASS application:\u00a0Yes\r\r\n                         Must submit a photocopy or a notarized copy of your dental school diploma to the program:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official NBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0No\r\n                         Must submit official INBDE results to ADEA PASS:\u00a0Yes \r\n                         Must submit a National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) score.

Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum: In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology. Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community. \r\nProgram Strengths:\u00a0Residents receive a rich, comprehensive\u00a0and robust education. Second year residents are well prepared\u00a0to take the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry\u00a0(ABPD) Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part\u00a0ABPD certification process. The majority of NYU Langone Dental\u00a0Medicine PEDS residents pass the QE go on to become board certified\u00a0diplomates of the ABPD.\u00a0\r\nResearch: Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting. The best research projects are also presented at the annual Research Fair, Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNYU Langone PEDS-HAWAII:\u00a0 NYU Langone\u00a0Dental Medicine Hawaii site\u00a0offers a unique experience unlike traditional hospital or university based pediatric dentistry programs. Residents receive their pediatric dental clinical training, serving the community by caring for patients in available community health centers (on four islands: \u00a0Oahu, Maui, Hawaii and Lanai) in collaboration with medical staff. Affiliated hospitals provide hospital and medical rotations required for specialty training. Throughout their residency, pediatric residents may, at their option, rotate through assignments on three different islands (Lanai, Maui, and the Big Island of Hawaii).\u00a0 Throughout the first and second year, residents will have opportunities to work on hospital cases at\u00a0Kona Community Hospital (Big Island of Hawaii, 2nd year), Shriners Hospital for Children and Kaiser Moanalua\u00a0Medical Center (Island of Oahu, 1st and 2nd year).\u00a0 It is emphasized that expenses for travel which include moving for the duration of your rotation on the islands of Lanai, Maui, and/or Hawaii, living, food, transportation and travel on the neighbor islands must be covered by the resident. Rotations on Oahu community health center sites include Saturday and Sunday assignments. Mandatory literature review, resident meetings, and other didactic assignments, which include presentations may be assigned on weekends or after clinical hours.\r\nFor questions about the NYU Langone Dental Medicine HI site, please contact Dr. Lynn Fujimoto, Associate Program Director.\u00a0 Phone: 808-741-4486.

{"title": "Missouri -Compass Health Network - PEDS", "body": "Compass Health Network\u00a0was established in June 1992 as an innovative community effort to provide primary and preventive health care to the medically underserved. Initial partners included three major hospitals, the Columbia Area United Way, the Columbia/Boone County Health Department, the University School of Medicine, and the Missouri Department of Social Services.\nServices were targeted to uninsured and underinsured Boone County families who did not have a health care provider. Instead of using emergency rooms for access to primary care services, Compass Health Network\u00a0offered them a \u201cmedical home\u201d with affordable, quality health care, close to home.\nIn 1995,\u00a0Compass Health Network organized itself as a not-for-profit corporation with a local governing board. The board consists of 13 voting members and five consulting members. Compass Health Network\u00a0patients comprise 51 percent of the board membership.\nCompass Health Network\u00a0received its Federally Qualified Health Center designation and its first Federal Grant in 1999. These grant funds are used to offset the cost of providing a sliding fee schedule for the underinsured and uninsured, low-income families served.\nToday, Compass Health Network\u00a0has locations in Columbia, Marceline and Salisbury that provide primary medical, mental health, and dental care services through board-certified physicians and nurse practitioners, licensed dentists, dental hygienists, clinical social workers and nurses. Compass Health Network\u00a0also provides medications assistance services for uninsured persons, referral to specialty care, referral to other community resources, and language interpretation services.\nThis health center is a Health Center Program grantee under 42 U.S.C. 254b, and a deemed Public Health Service employee under 42 U.S.C. 233(g)-(n).This project is supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under grant number H80CS00573 Health Center Cluster for $3,491,279, 76% financed by nonfederal sources.

Founded in 1994, by Dr. Silvia Perez-Spiess in Brooklyn, NY, the program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). The curriculum emphasizes pediatric medicine and dentistry, behavioral and pharmacologic management of children, oral biology, conscious sedation and general anesthesia for both the well child and those with special health care needs. Residents train with specialists in all disciplines of dentistry including orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics and dental anesthesia and develop expertise in treating patients who are medically compromised.\r\nThis innovative program is a hybrid blend of a strong distance learning didactic curriculum and extensive clinical experience. Distance-based didactic learning is achieved through asynchronous web-based education modules and a state-of-the-art video teleconference system that connects residents and faculty across all sites. With ample clinical exposure to pediatric medicine, conscious sedation and general anesthesia, graduates are trained to be an integral part of the medical team and hospital environment. Additional experience in hospital dentistry, craniofacial conditions, interceptive orthodontics, research, ethics and policy advocacy successfully prepares the graduate to pursue a career in private practice, public/community health or academia.\r\nPEDS Curriculum:\u00a0In Year 1, residents study most of the core curriculum, completing biomedical courses including oral biology, pediatric anesthesia, physical diagnosis, behavioral management, pediatric dentistry series, orthodontics, craniofacial development, and research methods and materials. At most sites, residents may attend monthly craniofacial conferences. Courses, electives, and requirements include core public health subjects. First-year residents also are assigned multiple rotations including pediatric medicine, general anesthesia, emergency medicine, phlebotomy, prenatal care, and on-call services.\r\nIn the second year, the curriculum is focused on children with complex medical conditions. Second-year residents are assigned with pediatric specialists to work in areas such as hematology, oncology, endocrinology, neurology, pulmonology, nephrology, cardiology, and immunology. Residents may rotate through nearby community health centers, Head Start/early child care centers or school-based programs to extend direct patient care to underserved children in the community. In addition, during Year 2 and with prior approval, residents may participate in a resident exchange, an optional merit-based, one-month rotation to any NYU Langone Dental Medicine\u00a0site.\r\nProgram Strengths:\u00a0American Board of Pediatric Dentistry (ABPD) Outcomes: Second year residents are required to take the ABPD Qualifying Examination (QE), the first of a two-part ABPD certification process. Over 90% of NYU Langone Dental Medicine PEDS residents pass the QE (national average 85%). More than 70% of graduates become board-certified diplomates of the ABPD (national average 65%).\r\nResearch:\u00a0Residents must complete a research project and, in Year 2, present their research posters at the annual AAPD meeting. The best research projects are also presented at the annual Research Fair in Brooklyn, NY.\r\nNYU Langone Dental Medicine PEDS-ARIZONA/Phoenix:\u00a0The NYU Langone Dental Medicine Phoenix site offers a unique experience unlike traditional hospital or university based pediatric dentistry programs. Residents receive their pediatric dental clinical training serving the community by caring for patients in a hospital, community health center, and private practice settings.\u00a0 The affiliated hospital, HonorHealth, located in Phoenix, provides experience with medical rotations required for specialty training. Rotations including anesthesia, on-call, emergency medicine, and pediatric medicine. Sub-specialty rotations occur at District Medical Group\u2019s Children\u2019s Rehabilitative Services (CRS) facility located in downtown Phoenix. Dental rotations occur at four locations \u2013NOAH Heuser Pediatric Dental, NOAH Palomino Family Health Center, Arizona School of Dentistry &amp; Oral Health (ASDOH), and KID-1 Pediatric Dentistry located in Casa Grande, AZ. At ASDOH, additional experiences are provided in public health outreach, and teaching. At KID-1 Pediatric Dentistry, emphasis is placed on the treatment of children under sedation and deep sedation/GA in-office, in a private practice setting. Additionally, residents also rotate through the Barrow Cleft and Craniofacial Center at St. Joseph Hospital and Medical Center and participate on the craniofacial team. \u00a0NOTE: NYU Langone Dental Medicine does not provide additional funding or travel reimbursement beyond the stipend. \u00a0Additionally, dental rotations may include Saturday assignments for pre-natal education and outreach screening events at local schools and/or participation in Special Olympics/Special Smiles.

{"title": "Division of Periodontics | College of Dental Medicine", "body": "Welcome to the Division of Periodontics at Columbia University, one of the oldest dental specialty divisions in the world. The division educates dental students in the specialty of Periodontics\u2014a discipline focusing on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal disease and in the placement of dental implants\u2014in a setting that emphasizes sound biological principles and evidence-based approaches. Our faculty guide our trainees in providing contemporary, comprehensive, and compassionate periodontal care to members of our surrounding community and those from the tri-state area who seek excellent specialty care at a renowned academic institution. The division also is home to three research labs whose investigations are advancing the professional knowledge base and developing innovative therapies in multiple clinical disciplines.\nThe predoctoral curriculum is designed to give students an understanding of the fundamental principles of Periodontics, knowledge of the range of procedures performed by periodontists, an appreciation of the importance of periodontal therapy in the context of comprehensive dental treatment, and the training necessary to provide patients with basic periodontal care.\nThe fundamental principles of periodontics are taught in an integrated fashion along with the other dental disciplines in the first- and second-year preclinical courses. These courses focus on a problem-oriented evaluation of the patient. At Columbia\u2019s comprehensive-care predoctoral clinic, third- and fourth-year students provide periodontal diagnoses and basic periodontal therapy to all of their patients. Additionally, third-year students participate in a rotation at the postdoctoral Periodontics program, where they attend didactic seminars and clinic sessions and participate in advanced periodontal and implant-related surgical procedures. All fourth-year dental students perform at least one periodontal surgery before graduation. Finally, fourth-year students who complete their clinical requirements early and have a particular interest in Periodontics may participate in an honors program where additional time is spent with the postdoctoral Periodontics curriculum.\nThe Postdoctoral\u00a0Periodontics Program\u00a0prepares the licensed dentist to practice the specialty of periodontics, either in private practice or in academia. Two parallel tracks are available: a primarily clinical track that leads to a Certificate in Periodontics\u00a0and a track that includes a substantial research component that leads to a Master of Science degree in Periodontics. Both tracks meet the educational requirements of the American Academy of Periodontology and the American Dental Association.\nThe Division offers one-week\u00a0externships\u00a0for third- and fourth-year dental students\u00a0as well as a\u00a0postdoctoral externship for foreign trained dentists.\u00a0\nMany of our faculty are practicing dentists with ColumbiaDoctors Dentistry, the faculty practice of the College of Dental Medicine. At these\u00a0sites, divisional faculty provide specialty treatment for the entire spectrum of periodontal diseases (gingivitis and periodontitis of various stages), including regenerative therapies (bone grafts), treatment for mucogingival defects (soft tissue grafts), pre-prosthetic procedures (crown lengthening, ridge augmentation/site development), and placement of dental implants for the rehabilitation of partial or full edentulism.\nThe Division of Periodontics also provides treatment for children and adults at the College of Dental Medicine's Teaching Clinics. Graduate dentists in specialty training provide care with the assistance and supervision of faculty specialists.\nThe division has several active research programs supported by multiple external sources including the National Institutes of Health, foundations, and industry. Current projects encompass the epidemiology and pathobiology of periodontitis, the microbially driven pathogenesis of oral and non-oral diseases, the identification of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes in the dental setting, and the evaluation of adjunctive approaches to enhance the outcomes of periodontal and peri-implant therapy.\nColumbia University has three research labs led by Periodontics faculty:\nResearch in the Han\u00a0laboratory focuses on the interactions of the vast population of microbes that inhabit various surfaces of the body and their human hosts. Visit the Han lab\u2019s web page.\nThe Momen-Heravi lab conducts immunology research with applications in periodontics, cancer, and diabetes. Specific projects include investigating how interactions between tumors and immune cells govern the progression of cancer, understanding the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and editing innate immune cells to combat cancer. Visit the Momen-Heravi lab\u2019s website.\nCurrent research of the Papapanou team centers on two main themes. One is understanding periodontitis pathobiology and the factors that affect susceptibility to periodontitis. The second focus is examining the role of periodontal infection/inflammation as a systemic health stressor. Visit the Papapanou lab\u2019s web page.\nThe Division of Periodontics publishes an annual newsletter to recognize the achievements of faculty and postdoctoral students and to highlight notable events and programming from the past year. Archived newsletters are available for download:\n2020 \u2022\u00a02019 \u2022 2018 \u2022 2017 \u2022 2016 \u2022 2015"},

It is designed to provide an advanced level of education and clinical experiences in periodontology and surgical implantology for highly qualified graduate dentists who are interested in a specialty career.\nThe goal of the UCLA Periodontics Residency Program is to train residents in the comprehensive evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of periodontal diseases and conditions. There is an emphasis on preservation of periodontal supporting structures and regeneration or reconstruction of lost periodontal/alveolar structures. Replacement of missing and hopeless teeth involves all aspects of surgery related to site preparation and placement of dental implants. Periodontal and implant treatment plans are developed and coordinated with other dental specialties as indicated by the individual patient\u2019s needs. Patient management skills are stressed, and residents are encouraged to approach all aspects of care with a biological, scientifically-based rationale.\nOne of the major strengths of the UCLA Periodontics Residency Program is the quality and dedication of our clinical faculty. Two clinically active faculty members are available during each clinic session while six residents are treating patients. As a result, residents get excellent faculty coverage, and they are exposed to a variety of treatment philosophies by periodontists who have diverse experiences.\nResidents are prepared to treat patients with a variety of light to moderate conscious sedation techniques including nitrous oxide, oral, and intravenous conscious sedation. The program provides the didactic and clinical experiences required for a conscious sedation permit in the State of California.\nA research thesis based on original work in clinical periodontics or on any of a number of related fields, but focused on problems relevant to periodontics, is required. The principles of scientific research design and evaluation are stressed. A Master's degree in oral biology or PhD\u00a0in\u00a0oral biology\u00a0can be pursued concurrently with the UCLA Periodontics Residency Program. Admission into this degree program requires a separate application through the UCLA Graduate Division.\nDuring the course of the program, residents will devote approximately 50% of their time to clinical activities, 20% of their time in didactic courses, 20% of their time involved in research and independent study, and 10% of their time teaching periodontics in the predoctoral clinics. A certificate of specialty training in Periodontics from the UCLA School of Dentistry is awarded upon completion of the program.\nSelected candidates will be invited to interview.\u00a0If you have been selected, you will be notified by telephone and/or email.\nTiming of Interviews:\u00a0Mid-October\nThe admissions committee considers the following criteria in its decisions:\nAcademic achievement\nLeadership activities\nResearch experience\nTeaching experience\nDemonstrated interest in periodontics\nApplicants will be notified of acceptance through the\u00a0Match\u00a0service.\u00a0Decisions will be available in November, per MATCH guidelines.\u00a0A letter of acceptance signed by the Program Director and Associate Dean of Academic Affairs will be issued upon acceptance.\nThe program in Periodontics is accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and has been granted the accreditation status of \"Approval without Reporting Requirements\u201d.

Provisional acceptance is offered to candidates in the final stages of dental education. Applications to postgraduate periodontology for a program leading to a certificate of specialization should be sent to ADEA Postdoctoral Application Support Service, PASS, (https://www.adea.org/pass/) on or before August 1 of the year before desired entry. Interviewing of prospective residents will be in the fall. UNMC College of Dentistry participates in the Postdoctoral Dental Matching Program and abides by the dates set by the Match program each year. For more information please see: https://natmatch.com/dentres/rules.html\nAdmissions to pursue postgraduate work in periodontology are limited to the number which can be handled to the advantage of the residents and the college. At the present time, usually two residents are accepted each year. Preference is given to those who have adequate preparation and aptitude.\nApplication instructions can be found\u00a0on the Instructions for Applicants\u00a0page.\u00a0\nApplicants for the program are considered on the basis of the following factors:\nIndividuals selected from the applicant pool for consideration for admission may be invited for a personal interview which is an additional basis for student selection.\nNon-U.S./Non-Canadian Degree Students At the present time foreign trained dentists (non-U.S. or non-Canadian dental degrees) are not being accepted for the postgraduate periodontal training program. This is because of licensing restrictions.\nEach resident's program provides a mixture of didactic instruction and clinical activity. The exact portion of time spent in each area varies somewhat with the resident's past experience and future goals.\nResidents are required to take core courses that will allow them to develop knowledge and expertise in the relationship of immunology, microbiology, pharmacology and cell biology to that of periodontal and implant diagnoses and treatments. Each resident develops clinical skills in diagnosis, treatment planning and therapy for patients with periodontal diseases and implant needs. All residents also develop competence in other clinical areas such as conscious sedation via oral, inhalation and intravenous routes.\nThere is also an opportunity to teach and lecture. Residents with an acute interest in education may choose electives through educational departments at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to expand knowledge and skills in areas such as teaching techniques, audiovisual production and testing/evaluation. The option to apply this information and actively participate in the design and presentation of didactic and clinical courses is available to the resident who plans a career in education.\nIn addition to the program of study required by the College of Dentistry's postgraduate education committee which oversees all the graduate specialty programs, the following are expected to be satisfactorily completed during the training program and prior to granting the certificate of specialization in periodontics:\nScholarly Activity During their tenure at the University of Nebraska, residents are expected to engage in some type of scholarly activity presented or published outside of the College of Dentistry. Common examples would be submission of a paper to a refereed journal, or presentation of an abstract at a regional or national meeting. The subject matter of this scholarly activity may be results of their research, a case report, a literature review, etc. This program requirement will be verified, prior to graduation, by the department chair.\nEmergencies and Pain Control The College of Dentistry has determined that a course in emergencies and pain control and participation on the CODE BLUE team and the after-hours emergency care program are parts of the academic program for all residents located in programs housed in the College of Dentistry in Lincoln.\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Each resident is required to be certified and maintain certification in basic CPR. A copy of the valid certification in basic CPR must be maintained at the College of Dentistry.\nAdvanced Cardiopulmonary Life Support (ACLS) Each resident will be certified during the program duration in ACLS.\nTeaching Participation in undergraduate teaching is a required activity, usually\u00a0two days per week, experienced in the third year of study.\nIn-Service Examination Each resident enrolled in the program will participate in the AAP's in-service examination given each year in the spring.

The clinical activities are located on the fourth floor of the school with additional laboratory space on the third floor.\n\n\n\n    Thank you for visiting our web site, and for your interest in prosthodontics! This is one of the fastest growing specialties in dentistry, and one of the most rewarding.\n\n\n    The goal of this program is to train prosthodontists who will be able to effectively rehabilitate patients who present with severely compromised oral conditions. Clinical treatment of patients is exemplified by excellence in three areas: planning, precision, and performance. Residents should exemplify these qualities by the end of the residency program. The primary goals of the didactic program are to provide  a literature base of the best available evidence from which to make sound clinical decisions, to train residents in the use and evaluation of literature to solve clinical problems, and to present a foundation of sound prosthodontic principles on which the resident can build in future years. The primary goals of the clinical program are to supply a breadth of experiences for residents to develop the clinical skills necessary for effective patient treatment in all aspects of prosthodontics.\n\n\n    While laboratory procedures are a necessary part of any prosthodontic program, the program utilizes lab support within the school as well as commercial dental labs to meet the needs of our patients. The latest digital workflows are constantly being utilized and improved and the residents are active in planning and designing restorations and implant position as well as radiographic and surgical guides. All of our residents design, assist, and place implants, and many with an interest in this area develop considerable surgical experience.\n\n\n    Our program is clinically oriented, and we are fortunate to have an extensive patient base and demand for prosthodontic services. Because of this, we are able to offer multiple clinical experiences in oral rehabilitation, esthetic dentistry, implant reconstructions, surgical implant placement, and removable and fixed prosthodontics. We also interface with the Maxillofacial Prosthetics program helping patients with cancer, trauma and craniofacial anomalies.\n\n\n    We look forward to reviewing your application and meeting you at UAB. \n\n\n    Dr. Wenchou, Wu DDS, MS, FACP, AFAAMP, Program Director\nUAB Graduate Prosthodontics\n1919 7th Ave South\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\nPhone: (205) 934-1072\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

{"title": "Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics | Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine", "body": "About the Program\n\u00a0\nThe purpose of the Stony Brook University Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics is to provide clinical, laboratory and didactic training, closely supervised, at the post-doctoral level in fixed, removable, and implant prosthodontics. The residents also obtain experience in surgical implant placement, maxillofacial prosthetics, temporomandibular dysfunction, as well as\u00a0digital dentistry in all facets of dentistry.\u00a0The residency program will work closely together with the other post-doctoral dental specialty education programs at the School of Dental Medicine and the General Practice Residency program. The residents will learn an interdisciplinary approach to providing dental care, so upon completion of the program, they will have the necessary background and training to work well with other dental professionals. The program director will strive to ensure that all program faculty members are current with prevailing prosthodontic theories and techniques.\nThe program integrates all facets of the biomedical sciences with a comprehensive clinical experience culminating in the award of the certificate in prosthodontics.\n\u00a0\nGoals of the Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics\nTo provide progressive clinical, laboratory and didactic training, closely supervised, at\nthe post-doctoral level in fixed, removable, maxillofacial prosthetics and implant prosthodontics. The interrelation of other medical/dental clinical specialties is also emphasized.\nThe Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics has the following objectives:\nThe 36-month Graduate Medical Education (GME) funded post-doctoral level program in fixed, removable and implant prosthodontics provides the candidate with clinical proficiency and comprehensive knowledge of the diagnosis, treatment planning, rehabilitation and maintenance of oral function, comfort, appearance and health of patients with missing/damaged teeth and orofacial defects by using biocompatible artificial substitutes. The curriculum includes didactic and clinical instruction in complete dentures, removable partial dentures, fixed prosthodontics, implant dentistry (including implant surgery), geriatrics, temporomandibular disorders and maxillofacial prosthetics. The didactic background and the clinical and laboratory skills of these areas of prosthodontics are stressed.\nEmphasis is placed on the periodontal integrity of the patient and the supportive therapy of all other disciplines in achieving total patient care. This integration is achieved through interdisciplinary seminars with the other specialties and through coordinated treatment planning.\nAdditionally, all residents are expected to perform a clinical or scientific research project culminating in presentation of their project at a national meeting and/or publication of the project. It is important for a well-rounded prosthodontic resident to experience all aspects of the specialty including research and teaching as well as the aforementioned clinical and laboratory skills.\nThe intensive and systematized library reading assignments and literature review seminars are an important aspect of the curriculum. They are designed to acquaint the resident with the principal facets of the prosthodontic specialty, evidence-based health care and methods of critically reviewing the dental literature.\nAll residents are encouraged to plan on pursuing certification by the American Board of Prosthodontics. To this end, the residents will be required to take Section A of the board exam and present at least two patient treatments that would satisfy the requirements of two parts of Section B of the board exam. Residents are encouraged to challenge one part of Section B of the American Board of Prosthodontics certification exam in February of their third year.\nThis program follows the guidelines established by the ADA for Advanced Educational Programs in Prosthodontics and the multidisciplinary scope of the specialty certificate examination of the American Board of Prosthodontics.\nYear I Curriculum\nAdvanced Prosthodontic Laboratory Techniques\nBiomedical Sciences: Core Courses for Advanced Education Programs\nClinical Prosthodontics\nComplete Denture Prosthodontics\nDental Materials Science\nDigital Dentistry Literature Review\nEthics &amp; Professionalism in Dental Practice\nFixed Partial Denture Prosthodontics\nGeriatrics\nImplant Dentistry \u2013 Current Topics\nImplant Dentistry \u2013 Introduction\nIntroduction to Digital Dentistry\nMedical Emergencies\nOral Pathology and Oral Medicine\nPeriodontal / Prosthodontic Treatment Planning Seminars\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Fixed Partial Prosthodontics Technique\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Removable Prosthodontics Technique\nProsthodontic Laboratory Techniques\nProsthodontic Treatment Planning Seminar\nResearch Design and Biostatistics\nYear II Curriculum\nAdvanced Implant Prosthodontics\nAdvanced Occlusal Concepts\nClinical Prosthodontics\nDigital Dentistry Literature Review\nMaxillofacial Prosthetics (didactic)\nMedical Emergencies\nOcclusion and Dental Morphology\nPeriodontal / Prosthodontic Treatment Planning Seminars\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Fixed Partial Prosthodontics Technique\nPractice Pre-Clinical Teaching \u2013 Removable Prosthodontics Technique\nProsthodontic Board Preparation\nProsthodontic Literature Review\nProsthodontic Treatment Planning Seminar\nRemovable Partial Prosthodontics\nSedation\nYear III Curriculum\nCleft Palate Conference\nClinical Prosthodontics\nCraniofacial Growth and Development\nDental Facial Deformities (DFD) Conference\nDigital Dentistry Literature Review\nHead and Neck Tumor Board Meeting\nMaxillofacial Prosthetics (clinical rotation)\nMedical Emergencies\nPeriodontal / Prosthodontic Treatment Planning Seminars\nPractice Management\nProsthodontic Board Preparation\nProsthodontic Literature Review\nProsthodontic Treatment Planning Seminar\nNon-Course Requirements\nResearch Project\nEach resident shall develop a research protocol and perform a research project related to prosthodontics.

{"title": "Prosthodontic Program - Penn Dental Medicine", "body": "Founding Program Director: Dr. Evanthia Anadioti, contact\nThe Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics, established in 2017, is the latest addition to the Graduate Dental Education Programs at Penn Dental Medicine.\nThe Specialty Education Program in Prosthodontics at the University of Pennsylvania is designed to prepare graduates to excel in clinical practice, research, and teaching within the specialty of Prosthodontics.\nThe Advanced Education Program in Prosthodontics at Penn Dental Medicine is designed to provide postdoctoral students with advanced training in prosthodontics and maxillofacial prosthetics. Successful completion of the 3-year program will satisfy the formal training requirement for eligibility for the American Board of Prosthodontics certification examination. This program is fully accredited by the American Dental Association\u2019s Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA).\nThe program begins on July 1, and continues through 36 calendar months. Postgraduate students spend approximately 60% of their time in clinic and are exposed to all facets of clinical prosthodontics. In addition to the core basic science courses required for all postgraduate students, the prosthodontic specialty curriculum provides progressive clinical, laboratory and didactic training, closely supervised, at the postgraduate level in fixed, removable, implant and digital prosthodontics. Dental microscopy, maxillofacial prosthodontics, surgical implant planning, placement, and restoration, full digital dentistry workflow, aesthetics, and the interrelation of other medical/dental clinical specialties are integrated aspects of the training, culminating in the award of the Certificate in Prosthodontics.\nThe rotation at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania enhances the educational experience by providing a wider range of patients with maxillofacial prosthetics needs, deeper understanding of medical conditions, and close collaboration with medical colleagues and other members of the health care team.\nThe highly respected research environment at Penn Dental Medicine and throughout the University of Pennsylvania provides a valuable opportunity for students applying to residency programs to combine their specialty training with advanced research and academic opportunities. To that end, the postgraduate students have the option to enroll to a Master of Science in Oral Biology degree program. The curriculum is integrated so that both the certificate and the Master of Science degree may be awarded simultaneously upon the completion of requirements, preparing students to successfully enter the field of academic dentistry, while also becoming skilled clinicians in specialty care.\nClinical Certificate Track: Certificate only (3 years)\nAcademic Track: MSOB and Certificate (3 years)\nNumber of students/residents accepted: 4 per year\nApplication Deadline: August 15 \u2014 See Graduate Dental Education Programs Admissions Requirements and Procedures for detailed information and instructions.\nAn applicant to be considered for admission to the Advanced Prosthodontics Program requires:\nApplication materials are reviewed and consideration for admission into the program is made on an individual basis.
