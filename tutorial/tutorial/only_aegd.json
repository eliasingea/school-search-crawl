This is a two-track program with a GPR track with four 4 residents and an AEGD track with 2 residents. Both programs share clinical facilities, have the same auxiliary staff, utilize the same attending faculty and share didactic lectures. All 6 GDR residents rotate in OMFS for 6 weeks divided into two three-week rotations; Emergency Medicine for 2 weeks; 2 weeks in Otolaryngology; 1 week in Radiation/Oncology and have a 1 week elective rotation in a medical or dental specialty. The 4 GPR track residents rotate in Anesthesia for 2 weeks and the AEGD track residents rotate in Pediatric Dentistry for 2 weeks. We believe this merger emphasizes the strengths of both programs \u2013 comprehensive general dentistry on patients with complex medical histories. A second year in either program is offered each year for one resident. At the successful completion of the GDR program each resident will receive either a GPR certificate or an AEGD certificate depending upon the track selected.\n\n\n    The General Dental Residency (GDR) Program is a postdoctoral educational program designed to provide essential skills, attitudes, and abilities related to the contemporary practice of advanced general dentistry, with emphasis on total patient care. The program provides the recent graduate the opportunity to augment his/her knowledge of oral disease and his/her diagnostic and therapeutic skills in dentistry. Treatment of oral disease in the medically complex patient and/or hospitalized patient is emphasized. A private practice environment is maintained throughout the program to assist the recent dental school graduate in the transition from academics to \u201creal world dentistry\u201d.\n\n\n    The formal goals and objectives are:\n\n\n    The GDR Program co-sponsored by the University of Alabama-Birmingham School of Dentistry and the UAB Hospital consists of 12 months of advanced dental education in clinical dentistry and is conducted primarily within a hospital environment.  An optional second GPR or AEGD year is available on a competitive basis. This latter position is generally limited to one position per year and is dependent upon qualifications.\n\n\n    Goal 1: Act as a Primary Health Care Provider at a level more advanced than a GPR/AEGD Level 1 resident.\n\n\n    Provide multidisciplinary comprehensive dental care to a wide variety of patients by pursuing training in advanced dental clinical fields of interest including but not limited to:\n\n\n    Goal 2: Obtain more advanced didactic training in both medicine and dentistry. \n\n\n    They will be offered graduate level courses in the following areas:\n\n\n    Goal 3: Complete medical/dental rotations not offered to Level 1 residents. \n\n\n    These may include:\n\n\n    Goal 4: The Level 2 resident will assume more administrative responsibility in the administration of a GPR/AEGD residency.\n\n\n    Goal 5: The Level 2 resident will gain experience in the academics of dentistry. \n\n\n    These experiences will include:\n\n\n    Note: In pursuing these objectives the Level 2 (PG2) resident will not repeat Level 1 (PG1) rotations and academic courses. It is anticipated the Level 2 resident will spend 15% more time delivering clinical dental care. Each Level 2 resident in conjunction with the program director will tailor this Level 2 year to his/her interests.\n\n\n    The program begins July 1st and concludes June 30th. In general, entering residents are required to report approximately the 20th of June for UAB Hospital orientation and help in patient transition (date to be provided after acceptance to the program).\n\n\n    Formal postgraduate courses taken with other post-graduate dental students include Physical Diagnosis, Conscious Sedation, and Dental Management of the Medically Complex Patient.  A portion of most Thursday mornings is set aside for resident seminars that range from formal lectures to treatment planning sessions. At these sessions other issues are discussed relating to the clinic practice (scheduling, emergencies, etc.). All GDR residents, including those on rotation, are required to attend these sessions. Space permitting, continuing education courses offered by the School of Dentistry are available for a minimal fee to postgraduate students.  Approximately 30 courses are offered each year at UAB.\n\n\n    Although not required, opportunities for research are available for the interested resident. Time is limited, but several motivated residents have successfully participated in a variety of research endeavors.

It also strives to serve as an educational model in clinical diagnosis, treatment, research and resources in caring for these populations.\nThe division developed a one-year postdoctoral Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency in July 2004. The program graduated its first residents in June 2005.\nThe residency program has many unique features. Most patient care takes place away from the medical center, at the Camino De Salud Residency Clinic, which has the look and feel of a private dental practice. The residency clinic also houses the Dental Ambulatory Surgery Center, where sedation dentistry is practiced. Residents experience aspects of hospital dentistry through inpatient hospital consultations, coverage of the emergency room and treating dental patients in the operating room.\nThe AEGD Program provides the best possible environment for dental graduates to further their education through providing advanced comprehensive oral health care to medically compromised and special needs populations. And, they gain this experience while living in a beautiful Southwestern setting.\nThe deadline to apply to the new Postgraduate Year 2 Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency is\u00a0December 30. 2020. The program, which has two open spots, is designed to refine and enhance residents\u2019 clinical skills to improve general dentistry.\nBoth our Postgraduate Year 1 and Year 2 residencies begin\u00a0July 1, 2021. Students who have completed their first year of postgraduate General Practice Residency or the AEGD program are eligible to\u00a0apply [PDF].\nThe Advanced Education in General Dentistry Residency Program at The University of New Mexico in Albuquerque is looking for applicants who have integrity and good interpersonal skills \u2013 someone who is a team player, assumes responsibility and is reliable.\nWe evaluate applicant essays, externships or extracurricular experiences in general (or specialty) dentistry, letters of evaluation, general extracurricular experiences, public health experience or other work experience, GPR/AEGD/other specialty advanced program completions, publications, presentations and research.\nAll applicants must hold a DDS, DMD or equivalent degree from an accredited U.S. or Canadian dental school prior to admission to the program.\nProspective candidates may download an application from the ADEA PASS Application and Match Registration site. PASS provides a standardized format, relieving applicants of the need to complete multiple applications.\nMaterial must be submitted by January 5, 2021. Late applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nThe AEGD program is open to graduates of American Dental Association accredited DDS or DMD programs in the U.S. or equivalent programs in Canada. Applicants must have passed Part I of the National Dental Board Examination and must pass Part II of the National Dental Board Examination prior to beginning the AEGD residency.\nFor the 2021-2022 application cycle, the UNM School of Medicine AEGD residency program participates in PASS and the Match. The program also does not require applicants to take the Advanced Dental Admission Test (ADAT).\nThe Professional Evaluation Form (PEF) is available in the ADEA PASS application.\nThe Professional Evaluation Form (PEF) is the mandatory letter of recommendation. It does not limit evaluators to a specific topic as special or unique applicant experiences can be highlighted. The AEGD program at UNM requires three (3) letters of professional evaluation. ADEA PASS will process the PEFs per designation.\nThe Institution Evaluation Form (IEF, also called the dean\u2019s letter) is an evaluation of the applicant completed by the dean of the dental school attended. The completed IEF is then sent to every program a candidate applies to. Included in the IEF are NBDE scores or results, a narrative statement and GPA and class rank (if applicable). This evaluation is required for every applicant.\nThe Admissions Committee reviews applications and conducts interviews. We do not mandate a specific minimum grade point average or board score. However, a personal interview at UNM is required prior to admission.\nUNM policies are followed with regard to resident selection. The Division of Dental Services considers all applicants for admission to its AEGD program without regard for ethnicity, creed, religion, handicap, national origin, gender or age.\nResidency training rests on specific objectives and competencies at the Department of Dental Medicine at The University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. These objectives are used to meet the program\u2019s goals. Proficiencies and competencies are tools that measure the resident\u2019s success in meeting the objectives. Proficiency is a higher level of achievement than competency. Consequently, a resident can move from competency to proficiency in the course of the year.\nThese goals are assessed quarterly through multiple evaluations (both of and by the residents) and through an end-of-the-year questionnaire administered to the residents. Periodic surveys of recent graduates will also be used to supplement the data collected. These data are reviewed by the program director and faculty and if needed, appropriate action is taken to improve the resident experience.\nThis program intends for each individual to become competent or even proficient in each of the goals. It's expected that your clinical and didactic experiences will enable you to attain a level of skill and complexity far beyond that achieved in dental school.\nUNM\u2019s Advanced Education In General Dentistry residency program provides a one-year experience in general dentistry in outpatient clinics, the operating room and a hospital setting.\nThe program provides an opportunity and the structure to achieve these competencies, but it's the resident's responsibility to gather the documentation that these skills have been attained. Full- or part-time faculty members will complete most of this documentation on standard forms.\nAt the conclusion of the one-year program, each resident should have fulfilled a set of expected competencies [PDF].\nThe curriculum at the Department of Dental Medicine at The University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque includes required didactic and clinical core elements as well as elective assignments. Residents attend seminars as well as local continuing education programs offered by organized dentistry throughout the academic year.\nWe have created a 10-week Special Care Dentistry curriculum, which covers developmental disabilities, geriatrics, sedation and anesthesia, as well as hospital-based dentistry.

The Commission on Dental Accreditation can be contacted at 312-440-4653 or at 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL\u00a0 60611. The Commission\u2019s web address is: http://www.ada.org/en/coda.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Commission on Dental Accreditation has accredited the program in advanced education in general dentistry (12 month). However, accreditation of the program does not in itself constitute recognition of any dental specialty status.\u00a0\nThe purpose of the UNMC College of Dentistry's AEGD program is to train recent dental school graduates to deliver comprehensive dental care to a wide range of patients with varying needs, in different clinical environments at an advanced level of skill and/or complexity beyond that accomplished in their pre-doctoral education. The resident\u2019s basic knowledge and skills will be reinforced and expanded in the areas of pathology, diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical and preventive dentistry, dental emergencies and pain and anxiety control utilizing behavioral and/or pharmacological techniques. In addition, the resident will be exposed to advanced training in the areas of endodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, pediatric dentistry, implantology, TMD and restorative dentistry. Furthermore, the program strives to instill in the resident, practice management and production skills that will translate into their private practices upon completion of the residency program. Finally, it will reinforce the necessity of lifelong learning and strengthen critical thinking to apply evidenced based patient care.\nGoals and Objectives of the Program\nThe Commission on Dental Accreditation describes the goals of an AEGD as follows:\u00a0Advanced Education Programs in General Dentistry are educational programs designed to provide training beyond the level of pre-doctoral education in oral health care, using applied basic and behavioral sciences. Education in these programs is based on the concept that oral health is an integral and interactive part of total health. The programs are designed to expand the scope and depth of the graduates\u2019 knowledge and skills to enable them to provide comprehensive oral health care to a wide range of population groups. The goals of these programs should include preparation of the graduate to:\nUpon successful completion of the one-year AEGD residency program at UNMC, the resident will receive a certificate. The following criteria will be utilized in evaluating the resident for certification. As part of the current competency and proficiency movement in postgraduate general dentistry, it will be the resident\u2019s responsibility to provide documentation of their experiences during the residency. (Competency statements are available on-site for review or are available upon request.) Documents will be gathered and presented for review by the faculty on a periodic basis. Documents will be stored through the use of a portfolio. Criteria for successful evaluation will be:\nProgram Director - The program has a director responsible for the day-to-day administration of the clinic. The director also spends a significant percentage of time with the residents in both clinical and educational components of the program.\nAttending Staff - Residents receive guidance, supervision, education and treatment planning advice from both generalists and specialists throughout the program. Specialists are available for consultation on a regularly scheduled basis and include endodontics, oral pathology, oral surgery, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, and oral-maxillofacial prosthetics. Patients are scheduled by the residents for consultation or supervision of treatment with a specialist when the resident feels the patient has need for special consideration.\nSupport Staff - Residents are provided with dental assistant support to allow for utilization of four-handed dentistry. A billing / insurance specialist and clinic scheduler are available to ensure efficient administration of patient scheduling, records and finances. Dental hygienists are also employed to help provide preventive, diagnostic, periodontal and other adjunct services to our patients.\nAttending Staff and Adjunct Faculty\nUNMC College of Dentistry Dental ClinicThe UNMC College of Dentistry Dental Clinic is located in the University of Nebraska Medical Center Durham Outpatient Center. The clinic was renovated in 2019. The project included\u00a015 fully equipped operatories, a laboratory, sterilization area, radiographic imaging room with a digital pantomograph unit, resident's room, scheduling office, billing office, large waiting room and restrooms.\nThe dental operatories in the clinic are fully equipped. The clinic utilizes a digital radiographic system and computer workstations for chairside use. The dental units are state-of-the-art equipment with fiber optic capabilities. A surgical endodontic microscope and CEREC Omnicam and Blue-cam with a milling unit for porcelain restoration fabrication are also available for resident\u2019s use. Rotary Endodontic and Implant Placement Systems, including handpieces, are frequently utilized as well as a soft-tissue laser. Several new complete sets of oral surgery instruments are available. A portable radiographic unit (Nomad) and dental unit as well as two portable pulse oximeters are available for treatment rendered in the operating room or on the patient floors.\nLibrarySince the program is located at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, an extensive library facility is immediately available for the resident's use. The McGoogan Health Sciences Library within the University Hospital has all necessary medical and most major dental publications. The C.Y. Thompson Library in Lincoln can supply other dental references or minor publications required for resident use. Library loan or courier service can provide journals, articles or books quickly. In addition, extensive audiovisual files are in the Medical Center Library for the resident's review. Computer access to internet reference sites is available in the clinic's resident room.\nDental residents spend approximately 75% of their time providing dental care to a wide variety of patients. These groups include:\nResidents will participate in the screening of patients admitted to the program and the development of definitive treatment plans. The treatment plans are presented to the attending staff in the dental clinic and at weekly treatment planning meetings. At that time, the attending staff will review the treatment plan with the residents and make recommendations, review options of treatment and discuss rationale of treatment plan decisions. An active Nebraska state dental license is necessary to participate in this program and to receive the stipend. Incoming residents will be provided with additional information regarding temporary state licensure.\nSpecial emphasis is given to oncology, liver transplant, heart transplant, pancreas transplant, cardiac valve replacement, HIV patients and their problems.

Emergency preparedness and safe work environment materials are available for review. Some of these documents will be provided to the resident during orientation.\nA number of educational programs have been developed for the dental residents. These educational programs are designed to provide the residents with additional exposure to both medical and dental problems and developments. The following programs are regularly scheduled for the resident's benefit:\nEducational seminars presented by the attending staff, guest lecturers or medical/dental specialists will focus on advanced techniques in the individual's specialty or interest areas. Educational seminars presented by the residents will focus on management of dental patients with special needs or complex management and on implant placement/restoration patient cases.\nOral pathology conferences are presented by an oral pathologist. The conferences review and augment the resident's knowledge of oral and general pathology as well as oral medicine.\nOral surgery conferences are presented by various medical or oral surgery attending staff or residents. The subjects covered include a variety of dental and medical problems, techniques important to diagnosis and management of patients and techniques or problems in oral surgery. Seminar subjects will cover basic and special considerations for inpatient and outpatient care of dental patients undergoing combined medical and dental procedures. Principles of fluid balance, laboratory interpretation, pain management, TMJ disorders, infection and medication management are just a few examples of subjects presented. A physical assessment course is also provided through the Oral Surgery Service.\nA six-week lecture course on a restorative approach to implants is also provided with the oral surgeons\u2014this addresses both surgical and restorative aspects of implant placement and restorative. Implant case conferences are held at the VA amongst the prosthodontist, generalists, oral surgeons and residents to discuss cases prior to implant placement and to achieve the best results surgically and restoratively.\nTreatment planning/case review seminars are monthly presentations of difficult or unusual dental patients. The residents are requested to present the patient's medical and dental problems, how they affect the patient and his/her treatment, and what treatment was prescribed and carried out.\nDistance Learning PolicyDidactics are available remotely utilizing Zoom teleconferencing. To assure academic integrity, and to maintain security and privacy, residents gain access to course materials and educational resources by means of secure login authentication. Upon admission to UNMC, each resident is assigned a unique electronic identity, which is protected by a password. All communications are managed through the secured learning management system, including contact with the instructor and collaboration with peers. The submission of assignments, and accessing grades are not planned to be communicated through remote learning. Attendance and verification are also easily accomplish via simple voice and video identification during live broadcast teleconferences. There is no charge to the residents for distance education.\nEmergency On CallResidents will provide emergency on call while at the College of Dentistry in Lincoln when on rotation there.\nOff-Service Rotations\nEach rotation is expected to enhance and enrich the resident\u2019s experiences. The clinic directors at each site will be invited to participate in orientation activities or participate as available in an orientation week held in July in order to review program goals and objectives and conduct calibrations. They will be responsible for supervising the residents and providing evaluations of the resident\u2019s performance.\nImmunizationsThe University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Dentistry policy requires that all entering students in programs requiring patient contact must be vaccinated or exhibit active immunity to tetanus, measles*, mumps, diphtheria, chicken pox, polio, rubella and Hepatitis B and have had a TB skin test within the last six months, unless the student has a previous positive test/medical contraindication.

Dental residents may be entitled to in-school deferments on existing student loans. If you are entitled to receive one, you should be proactive in ensuring that you receive your deferment.\nLenders must grant an in-school deferment based on enrollment and in-school status of a borrower as certified by an institution of higher education or an affiliated hospital. It is anticipated that lenders will be able to determine the borrower's eligibility for the deferment based on:\nAgain, dental residents must double-check to see if this has occurred. If the lender defers the loan based on a loan application or enrollment status information, the lender must notify the borrower that the deferment was granted and give the borrower the option of continuing to repay the loan.\nLoan consolidation can simplify repayment and may lower your monthly payment. You can combine your student loans even if you borrowed from more than one lender, have more than one type of loan or have different interest rates or repayment plans on the loans.\nYou must be in your grace period, deferment or in repayment to consolidate your loans. The following loans may be consolidated:\nYou can choose which loans to consolidate. Under certain circumstances, consolidation loans can be consolidated with other student loans. Check with the Direct Loan Program for details about loan consolidation.\nThe fixed interest rate is based on the weighted average interest rate of all the loans your consolidate, rounded up to the next highest 1/8%, with a maximum rate of 8.25%. Your student loan interest may be tax deductible if you meet certain conditions. Contact your tax advisor or the IRS for details.\nYou have a choice of a standard, graduated, income-sensitive or extended repayment plan, and you may change the repayment plan once a year. Depending on the total amount of your student loans, the repayment will take 10 to 30 years.\nContact the\u00a0Direct Loan Program\u00a0to apply for loan consolidation. If you are in repayment, the program can temporarily suspend your loan payments while your consolidation is being processed.\nThe following statements describe the graduates of Pacific's AEGD program. They are intended to communicate the expectations of the faculty to the resident and serve as the basis for evaluation of resident's satisfactory completion of the program.\nIn order to facilitate reading this list of statements,\u00a0certain terms have been predefined\u00a0to avoid repetitive definition.\u00a0In general, the definitions proposed by Chambers and Gerrow have been followed, albeit with some additions and modifications.\nIn situations where it is expected that the program graduate will be able to, and likely to, actually perform the necessary procedures, the terms \"perform\", \"provide\", \"restore\", or \"treat\" have been used.\nIn circumstances where the graduate may perform some treatment but is more likely to oversee treatment or refer, the term \"manage\" is used.\nTo avoid repetition, the term \"appropriate\" is not used in these statements. It is assumed that all knowledge, skills, and procedures described will be performed for appropriate reasons, in appropriate circumstances, and in an appropriate manner.\nEach statement is designated as an area of competency\u00a0(C)\u00a0in which graduates are expected to have little experience at the beginning of their programs, but\u00a0competent at a student level. \u00a0At the end of the program, the resident will gain further experience, skill, and judgment as the program progresses at a resident competency level.\nThe following are competency statements that describe the additional areas, beyond those of the first year program, that apply to residents completing the second year program. 1. Integrate all aspects of dentistry in the treatment of patients with complex dental, medical and social situations.\u00a0(C)\nAdapted from Chambers and Gerrow1\u00a0\nAssess.\u00a0Evaluation of physical, written, and psychological data in a systematic and comprehensive fashion to detect entities or patterns that would initiate or modify treatment, referral, or additional assessment. Assessment entails understanding of relevant theory, and may also entail skill in using specialized equipment or techniques. But assessment is always controlled by an understanding of the purpose for which it is made and its appropriateness under the present circumstances. Recognition is a more limited term that does not subsume the notion of evaluating findings. Diagnosis is a more inclusive term which relates evaluated findings to treatment alternatives.\nCompetency.\u00a0Behavior expected of the beginning practitioner. This behavior incorporates understanding, skill, and values in an integrated response to the full range of requirements presenting in practice. The level of performance requires some degree of speed and accuracy consistent with patient well-being but not performance at the highest level possible. It also requires an awareness of what constitutes acceptable performance under the circumstances and desire for self improvement.\nDiagnose.\u00a0Diagnosing means systematically comparing a comprehensive database on the patient with an understanding of dental and related medical theory to identify recognized disease entities or treatable conditions. The concept of diagnosis subsumes an understanding of disease etiology and natural history.\nDiscuss\u00a0(communicate, consult, explain, present).\u00a0 A two-way exchange that serves both the practitioner's needs and those of patients, staff, colleagues, and others with whom the practitioner communicates. The conversation, writing, or other means of exchange must be free of emotional or other distorting factors and the practitioner must be capable of expressing and listening in terms the other party understands. [Caution should be exercised with using these verbs to ensure that the communication is between the practitioner and the patient. Communication between the student and faculty is language reminiscent of the old instructional objectives and is not evidence of competency.]\nDocument.\u00a0Making, organizing, and preserving information in standardized, usable, and legally required format.\nManage.\u00a0Management refers to the selection of treatment-including: no intervention; choice of specific care providers-including hygienists, and medical and dental specialists; timing and evaluation of treatment success; proper handling of sequela; and insurance of patient comprehension of and appropriate participation in the process. In circumstances where the graduate may perform some treatment but is more likely to oversee treatment or refer, the term \"manage\" is used. In situations where it is expected that practitioners will be capable of and likely to provide treatment as well as oversee it, the terms \"treat\", \"provide\", or \"perform\", will be used.\nMonitor.\u00a0Systematic vigilance to potentially important conditions with an intention to intervene should critical changes occur. Normally monitoring is part of the process of management.\nObtain\u00a0(collect, acquire). Making data available through inspection, questioning (patients, physicians, relatives), review of records etc., or capturing data by using diagnostic procedures. Health histories, radiographs, casts, and consults are obtained. It is always assumed that the procedures for obtaining data are performed accurately so that no bias is introduced, are appropriate to the circumstances, and no more invasive than necessary, and are legal.\nPatients With Special Needs.\u00a0Those patients whose medical, physical, psychological, or social situations make it necessary to modify normal dental routines in order to provide dental treatment for that individual. These individuals include, but are not limited to, people with developmental disabilities, complex medical problems, and significant physical limitations.\nPerform (conduct, restore, treat).\u00a0When a procedure is performed, it is assumed that it will be done with reasonable speed and without negative unforeseen consequences. Quality will be such that the function for which the procedure was undertaken is satisfied consistent with the prevailing standard of care and that the practitioner accurately evaluates the results and takes needed corrective action. All preparatory and collateral procedures are assumed to be a part of the performance.\nPractice.\u00a0Used to describe a general habit of practice, such as \"practice consistent with applicable laws and regulations.\"\nPrepare\u00a0(see perform).\nPresent\u00a0(see discuss).\nPrevent\u00a0[the effects of]. The negative effects of known or anticipated risks can be prevented through reasonable precautions. This includes understanding and being able to discuss the risk and necessary precautions and skill in carrying out the precaution. Because preventing future damage is of necessity a response to an internalized stimulus rather than a present one, additional emphasis is placed on supportive values.\nProvide care\u00a0(see perform).\nRecognize\u00a0(differentiate, identify). Identify the presence of an entity or pattern that appears to have significance for patient management. Recognition is not as broad as assessment -- assessment requires systematic collection and evaluation of data. Recognition does not involve the degree of judgment entailed by diagnosis. [Caution is necessary with these terms. They are often use in the old instructional objectives literature to refer to behavior students perform for instructors. They can only be used for competencies when practitioners recognize, differentiate, or identify for patients or staff.]\nRefer.\u00a0A referral includes determination that assessment, diagnosis, or treatment is required which is beyond the practitioner's competency. It also includes discussion of the necessity for the referral and of alternatives with the patient, discussion and cooperation with the professionals to whom the patient is referred, and follow-up evaluation.\nRestore\u00a0(see perform).\nSkill.\u00a0The residual performance patterns of foundation skills that is incorporated into competency. The importance of the skill is more than speed and accuracy: it is the coordination of performance patterns into an organized competency whole.\nTreat\u00a0(see perform).\nUse.\u00a0This term refers to a collateral performance. In the course of providing care, precautions and specialized routines may be required. For example, infection control and rapport building communication are used. Understanding the collateral procedure and its relation to overall care is assumed. It is often the case that supporting values are especially important for procedures that are needed -- they are usually mentioned specifically because their value requires reinforcement. [\"Utilize\" is a stylistic affectation that should be avoided.]\nUnderstanding.\u00a0The residual cognitive foundation knowledge that is incorporated into competency. Understanding is more than broad knowledge of details: it is organized knowledge that is useful in performing the competency. [Caution should be used with this term. Understanding alone is not a competency; it must be blended with skill and values.] Values. Preferences for professional appropriate behavior in the absence of compelling or constraining forces. Values can only be inferred from practitioner's behavior when alternatives are available. \"Talking about\" values reflects a foundation knowledge; valuing can be inferred by observing the practitioner's attempts to persuade others. [Caution should be used with this term. Valuing alone is not a competency; it must be blended with skill and understanding.]\n155 Fifth Street\r\nSan Francisco, CA 94103", "Program Name": "University of the Pacific, Union City", "Program Type": "Advanced Education in General Dentistry (12 months)", "url": "https://dental.pacific.edu/dental/academic-programs/advanced-education-in-general-dentistry", "keywords": ["other sedatives", "nitrous oxide", "resident competency", "principal balance", "advanced education", "specialized routines", "current rotations", "organized competency", "repetitive definition", "general anesthesia"]},
